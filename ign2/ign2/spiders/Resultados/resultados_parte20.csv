Joined by hard-boiled mercenaries Mad Dog and Scorpion, the warriors must once again wage war against an entire army of invaders.

Refining the 2D side-scrolling genre, Contra 4 delivers pure action at a fever pitch as players jump, shoot, and dodge oncoming hazards. Utilizing a new dual screen presentation, the action spans both screens of the Nintendo DS, giving players the opportunity to battle across expansive environments in which death can come from any direction. The use of both screens for the game's core action also allows for massive boss battles as players try to seek and destroy the weak points of sky-high enemies. A first for the series, Contra 4 introduces a grappling hook accessory that lets players grab onto elements of the environment directly above them. Whether using it to avoid oncoming dangers or attack from a strategic vantage point, the grappling hook allows for new combat situations and dramatic set pieces that underscore the game's adrenaline-soaked pedigree. The game also continues the multiplayer tradition of previous games in the series, by letting two players battle together against Black Viper's army of vile alien forces and reclaim Earth for mankind.

To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the popular Contra franchise of video games, Konami Digital Entertainment also has incorporated a wealth of in-game bonus content into its latest entry in the run and gun action franchise.",Contra 4,http://www.ign.com/games/contra-4/nds-944841,http://ds.ign.com/articles/834/834843p1.html,29.99 USD,8.0,NDS Cell,"November 13, 2007","http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-phantom-hourglass/nds-694756,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-spirit-tracks/nds-14333936,http://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-3582-days/nds-964462,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-black-version-2/nds-129224,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-conquest/nds-125156,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-white-version-2/nds-129228",Great,8.6,"Blood and Gore, Fantasy Violence, Language",T for Teen,Great

Nintendo,Platformer,Rare,"A downloadable version of the 1996 SNES game, provided through Nintendo's Virtual Console service.

Revisit Donkey Kong Island and join the Kong family for their latest adventure. The Kremlings have a mysterious new leader named KAOS and are up to their usual mischief, even capturing Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong. Now it's up to Dixie Kong and the newest Kong, a giant infant named Kiddy, to rescue the two missing apes. They'll travel across previously unseen parts of the island in their search, and even take to the skies in a rocket at one point. Lucky for them, Dixie and Kiddy's powers complement each other (including Kiddy's talent for rolling like a barrel), so they form a powerful team capable of major Kremling damage. They're not completely on their own, either, since returning favorites like Funky Kong and Enguarde the swordfish provide help along the way. And in a series known for its abundance of secrets and high replay value, this entry doesn't disappoint, with enough hours of game play to satisfy Donkey Kong himself.
