Pac-Man makes a rare appearance outside of a maze environment in Pac-Attack, a fun and quirky puzzle game. This unique entry in the genre puts its own twist on established conventions and adds one of gaming's most iconic characters to the mix. The goal is simple: Keep your screen clear of falling blocks and ghosts by lining up blocks horizontally, causing them to disappear. Clearing the ghosts, though, requires the help of a hungry Pac-Man (who just happens to swing by every so often for a snack). It's up to you to get all of the ghosts lined up for him, because Pac-Man will keep eating them until he is stopped by a block or he runs out of ghosts. In addition, his range of movement on the playing field is limited to horizontal or downward—thus adding further strategy. There are three game modes to choose from: 1 Player Normal, 2 Player VS., and the challenging 1 Player Puzzle.

Once more you consider the grid. Perhaps their destroyer lies in wait near that island. You call out a new strike: D-2. This time, the missile finds a target. You direct the next attack at an adjacent square and once again hit paydirt. From there, you deduce the rest of the enemy ship's location and sink their aircraft carrier.

With the burgeoning city of Midgar as its base and symbol of prosperity, Shinra is on the verge of establishing absolute dominance over the world.

Konami,Sports,Konami,"The Wii version of PES offers the same level of realism that has established the series as the definitive football title, but has been undergone a radical rethink to make the most of the Wii's motion-sensitive control system. Using a point and drag system, the player uses the Wii Remote to guide the player with the ball, and perform all the skill moves and close control with subtle movements of their hand. The new system gives the player full control over their team, and allows the man marking of specific threats, while shakes of the Wii Nunchuk can be used to perform sliding tackles, and send the goal keeper out to clear a loose ball. The strategic elements are also easily accessed, with the directional controls of the Wii Remote used to activate tactical plays and spring counter attacks or send players tracking back.

PES 2008 for Wii features six game modes, spanning Match, League and Cup elements, and Training and Trade section. The new version also features an exclusive Champions Road competition, wherein players take their chosen team to compete in league competitions all over the world. Full Mii support is also present, and users can integrate up to 16 pre-defined Miis into a team, while the ever-changing teams can be stored on to the Wii Remote and switched between two linked Remotes.

PES 2008 also has an online element, allowing users to play Free Matches against unknown opponents, or Friend Matches against people on the Wii's Friends list. Team data can also be sent to friends via the console's WiiConnect24 system.",Pro Evolution Soccer 2008,http://www.ign.com/games/pro-evolution-soccer-2008/wii-827202,http://wii.ign.com/articles/860/860254p1.html,39.99 USD,8.6,Wii PS3 Cell Xbox 360 PC PSP PS2 NDS,"March 18, 2008","http://www.ign.com/games/wii-sports/wii-826987,http://www.ign.com/games/wii-sports-resort/wii-14266992,http://www.ign.com/games/fifa-2013/wii-115690,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/wii-865246,http://www.ign.com/games/the-last-story/wii-59789,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword/wii-872155",Good,7.9,,E for Everyone,Great
