"Atlus, SEGA",Puzzle,SEGA,"PUYO POP FEVER from Altus sends players into a world of bizarre yet cute characters who battle it out using puyos, colored gumdrops that fall from the sky. Like many puzzle games, the goal is to link up like-colored puyos into chains of four to make them vanish. PUYO POP FEVER features several different game play modes. The single-player story mode sends players through the world battling against different foes to become the best. There is also an endless mode, a mission mode where a certain challenge must be completed under the time limit, and dedicated fever mode, in which players must clear the whole screen as quickly as possible by placing puyos in the correct spot. The head-to-head mode allows players to go up against live opponents or against the computer, and multiplayer mode supports up to eight gamers using just one copy of the game. Players can tweak the rules used in multiplayer games, even creating customized ones. The most unique feature of PUYO POP FEVER, though, appears when players activate the fever mode during gameplay. The regular gameplay stops and players are given a new field and a pair of puyos. Place the puyos in the right spot results in massive combos that can literally clear the screen. This speed is much quicker, however, so players must learn how to quickly find the perfect places to place their puyos.

Players won't need to touch the control pad or the buttons here: the game is entirely controlled by using the stylus and the touch screen. Players draw lines, bridges, and walls to maneuver Kirby or to protect him from enemies. Kirby spends a lot of time as a ball in the game while players draw bridges over pits, walls to change his direction, and barriers to protect him from enemy attacks. Different colored lines have different properties as well, so players will have to be quick in changing colors. When Kirby comes unrolled, he can use a dash attack or copy enemy special moves. The game is broken up in to several different worlds, each comprised of three levels. At the end of each world, players select one of three bosses to battle. Players have the choice of the same three bosses for each world, but the more a player fights a boss, the stronger that boss becomes. Once the main game is completed, there are several other quests.

Nintendo,Action,Artoon,"In Yoshi Universal Gravitation, Yoshi Island has been turned into a picture book. Yoshi will not stand for this outlandish attempt at flattening his world, and he heads off on an adventure to return things back to their original state. To help in on his quest, a group of spirits who like to surprise people give Yoshi the ability to rotate the world to his liking.
The big catch with Yoshi Universal Gravitation is its use of a motion sensor, similar to the one set to be featured in the second Wario Ware GBA game. The game cartridge includes a built in motion sensor which detects how you move the GBA system. By turning the system, you make the world rotate.

Batman uses a slight degree of stealth.

Midway  Games,"First-Person, Shooter",Midway Studios -- Austin,"The AREA 51 series first began as a light gun-based arcade shooter game, and now Midway has brought the series to the Pc Games as a first person shooter along the lines of HALO and DOOM. The game revolves around HAZMAT operative Ethan Cole, who has been summoned to Area 51 to discover the source of a deadly virile outbreak. He soon discovers that the staff of the secret alien research base has mutated into deadly, dangerous enemies. Even worse, Ethan himself quickly becomes infected. While the game is a fairly straight-forward first person shooter involving blasting everything that moves while searching for keys, secret codes, and other clues, it does have some interesting twists. Once Ethan becomes infected with the virus, he gains the ability to mutate into a stronger form complete with two ranged attacks. The visuals also change, taking on an almost infra-red interface. Once the single-player missions are finished, AREA 51 offers gamers a multiplayer mode that accommodates up to 16 players. Several different options are available, including deathmatch, capture the flag, and infection, in which players can play as mutants and attempt to infect the human players. There are also unlockable secrets that can be found by scanning objects, , computer workstations, and corpses.

Like the movie, the game takes players across the universe from planets like Kahyyk to Coruscant and beyond.

Players will work their way across 21 levels and face off against a host of recognizable enemies like Mace Windu and Count Dooku and a new foe, General Grievous. In addition to light sabers, players command the Force to move objects in a wide variety of interesting maneuvers. At the end of each level, players are evaluated on how well they did and awarded Force points that can be used to purchase new abilities or upgrade existing ones. Also, as Anakin gets closer and closer to the Dark Side, his powers change accordingly, opening up new moves and abilities. Players can also play through the game cooperatively using the GBA link.

Activision,Action,,"Activision has captured all the excitement of the new FANTASTIC 4 movie and brought it to the GBA. In FANTASTIC 4, players take control of the entire team to battle the evil Dr. Doom while learning about their new fantastic powers and abilities. The game follows the basic story of the new movie. A group of five venture into space on a scientific mission, but soon find their shuttle inundated with powerful radiation. Upon returning to earth, they find that their bodies have changed and that they now have superhuman powers. One, Dr. Viktor Doom, is corrupted by his powers, and the other four vow to stop him. Players have the entire team at their control and can switch between them quickly, although there will be some levels where, as dictated by the plot, certain characters will be unavailable. Each has unique attacks and cosmic moves (powerful attacks that use up energy): Mr. Fantastic, who can stretch his body at will, allowing him to attack from long range; the Invisible Woman can turn invisible and freeze enemies; the Human Torch controls fire and can fly; and the Thing has a rock solid body and super strength. While battling the forces of Dr. Doom, players can unlock extras like artwork, comic book excerpts, and new outfits by playing mini-games.

Electronic Arts,Sports,EA Canada,"Hit the ice with EA Sports' NHL 06 for the Game Cube. This entry in the NHL series builds on the 2005 version by adding new rules and an up to date rooster that includes every big name in the National Hockey League. NHL 06 includes everything from NHL 05, including the revamped shooting controls. New to the 2006 version is the use of the left analog stick for deking, which in hockey terms means to dodge and fake out defenders. The right analog stick is used to pull off fancy moves like a spin or between the legs pass. These fancy moves will distract goalkeepers, giving the gamer an opening to shoot. The drawback to these moves is that only superstar characters can pull them off regularly. The game includes many of the traditional hockey game modes, including dynasty mode. In dynasty mode, gamers will control their own hockey team and have to deal with outside pressures, sponsors, and more while trying to meet the team philosophy, which is different for each team. Other modes include single season, leagues and tournaments, and quick game. The graphics of NHL 06 are top notch. This time, they've been tweaked to accurately show character size differences. The defense players and goalkeepers, who are traditionally larger players, actually look larger, while the smaller and faster scorers are indeed a little thinner and smaller.

Electronic Arts,Sports,EA Canada,"Hit the ice with EA Sports' NHL 06 for the PS2. This entry in the NHL series builds on the 2005 version by adding new rules and an up to date rooster that includes just about every big name in the National Hockey League. NHL 06 includes everything from NHL 05, including the revamped shooting controls. New to the 2006 version is the use of the left analog stick for deking, which in hockey terms means to dodge and fake out defenders. The right analog stick is used to pull off fancy moves like a spin or between the legs pass. These fancy moves will distract goalkeepers, giving the gamer an opening to shoot. The drawback to these moves is that only superstar characters can pull them off regularly. The game includes many of the traditional hockey game modes, including dynasty mode. In dynasty mode, gamers will control their own hockey team and have to deal with outside pressures, sponsors, and more while trying to meet the team philosophy, which is different for each team. Other modes include single season, leagues and tournaments, quick game, and online play. The graphics of NHL 06 are top notch. This time, they've been tweaked to accurately show character size differences. The defense players and goalkeepers, who are traditionally larger players, actually look larger, while the smaller and faster scorers are indeed a little thinner and smaller. This is just one small change that adds to the overall amazing gameplay of NHL 06.",NHL 06,http://www.ign.com/games/nhl-06/ps2-746189,http://ps2.ign.com/articles/649/649289p1.html,29.99 USD,8.5,PS2 Xbox 360 Xbox PC GCN,"September 6, 2005","http://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-2001/ps2-14286,http://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-underground/ps2-545800,http://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-4/ps2-482065,http://www.ign.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4/ps2-14241813,http://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ii/ps2-811719,http://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ii/ps2-888576",Great,8.3,Mild Violence,E10+ for Everyone 10 and older,Great

Nintendo,"Third-Person, Action",Kuju  Entertainment,"Nintendo presents Battalion Wars for the Game Cube, a military action strategy game that doesn't take itself too seriously. Instead, the game presents players with a unique style of graphics and character design, fun shooter controls, and a good amount of humor. Players take on the role of a field officer in Battalion Wars. As an officer in the Western Frontier army, players find themselves battling the forces of the Tundran Empire at first, but the Empire and the Frontier quickly find themselves signing a peace treaty and uniting against the Xylvanians, a third faction that attacks both groups after they are weakened. Players then take direct control of their squad and head to the battlefield. One of the interesting aspects of Battalion Wars is that players aren't represented by any one character. Instead, they can take control of any unit on the battlefield. This allows gamers to jump around during the battle, controlling an infantryman for a few minutes, then switching to a vehicle to perform a quick assault, then taking control of a heavily armed solider to take down a bunker. The other units, of course, continue their attacks even when the player isn't controlling them, creating an interesting system of battle. Battalion Wars combines strategy with a third person shooter in such a way that players will enjoy. With the ability to command many different units in the same battle and plan strategies involving different units, Battalion Wars is a great humorous war game for all players.",Battalion Wars,http://www.ign.com/games/battalion-wars/gcn-676364,http://cube.ign.com/articles/650/650932p1.html,49.99 USD,8.8,GCN,"September 19, 2005","http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker/gcn-17012,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-4/gcn-15821,http://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime/gcn-15316,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker/gcn-17012,http://www.ign.com/games/super-smash-bros-melee/gcn-16387,http://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-sunshine/gcn-16713",Great,8.4,Animated Violence,T for Teen,Great

Electronic Arts,Sports,EA Canada,"Hit the ice with EA Sports' NHL 06 for the XBOX. This entry in the NHL series builds on the 2005 version by adding new rules and an up to date rooster that includes just about every big name in the National Hockey League. NHL 06 includes everything from NHL 05, including the revamped shooting controls. New to the 2006 version is the use of the left analog stick for deking, which in hockey terms means to dodge and fake out defenders. The right analog stick is used to pull off fancy moves like a spin or between the legs pass. These fancy moves will distract goalkeepers, giving the gamer an opening to shoot. The drawback to these moves is that only superstar characters can pull them off regularly. The game includes many of the traditional hockey game modes, including dynasty mode. In dynasty mode, gamers will control their own hockey team and have to deal with outside pressures, sponsors, and more while trying to meet the team philosophy, which is different for each team. Other modes include single season, leagues and tournaments, quick game, and online play. The graphics of NHL 06 are top notch. This time, they've been tweaked to accurately show character size differences. The defense players and goalkeepers, who are traditionally larger players, actually look larger, while the smaller and faster scorers are indeed a little thinner and smaller. This is just one small change that adds to the overall amazing gameplay of NHL 06.",NHL 06,http://www.ign.com/games/nhl-06/xbox-746188,http://xbox.ign.com/articles/649/649284p1.html,29.99 USD,8.5,Xbox Xbox 360 PS2 PC GCN,"September 6, 2005","http://www.ign.com/games/espn-nfl-2k5/xbox-674666,http://www.ign.com/games/dead-or-alive-xtreme-beach-volleyball/xbox-482154,http://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-american-wasteland/xbox-740724,http://www.ign.com/games/halo-2/xbox-482228,http://www.ign.com/games/halo-combat-evolved/xbox-15922,http://www.ign.com/games/fable/xbox-16526",Great,8.5,Mild Violence,E10+ for Everyone 10 and older,Great

Tecmo,Action,Tecmo,"Before home video game consoles and personal computers, there were arcades that lured young players out with their games, and among those were the Tecmo gaming systems. These classics are now available for players at home with TECMO CLASSIC ARCADE by Tecmo for the Xbox. The eleven games included in this compilation are: TECMO BOWL, RYGAR, PLEIADS, SOLOMON'S KEY, BOMB JACK, SENJYO, PINBALL ACTION, STAR FORCE, SWIMMER, and STRATO FIGHTER. Now while most of these titles may not have been the most popular ones that were available back in the day, the sheer obscurity of them is something that may attract somewhat of a cult following among die hard arcade fans. One of the best features for fans of this bygone era is the fact that games are showcased with their original graphics and game play, giving players the feeling that they are right in the middle of the arcade. An added extra to these classics is the artwork that is included and user manuals in case the players aren't familiar with these rare titles. However, the best feature for those interested in purchasing TECMO CLASSIC ARCADE is the fact that they no longer have to pump quarters into a machine for hours on end in order to enjoy their favorite games.

Konami,Music,Konami TYO,"Konami's hit dancing series returns with DANCE DANCE REVOULTION EXTREME 2 for the PS2. Featuring new songs, new game modes, and, for the first time ever, online play. Gamers who have never played DDR before will find DDR EXTREME 2 to be a great starting point, and return players will love the new additions. In any dancing game, the song list is very important, and DDR EXTREME 2 includes covers of many great hits. Genie in a Bottle, Crazy in Love, and Get Busy are just a few titles that will keep gamers dancing for hours. DDR EXTREME 2 includes many of the standard DDR modes plus a few new ones. The main mode this time around is Dance Master Mode, which is the mode in which players will unlock other songs, modes, and dancers. Free Play Mode allows gamers to play any song they've unlocked, and unlike previous DDR games, it ends when the player decides to exit instead of after 3 songs. The game also includes lesson mode, practice mode, and the very challenging Advanced mode. DDR EXTREME 2 also features online play. Gamers can dance against others or check the rankings to see who is currently the DDR champion. Players are ranked, too, so beginners can easily avoid going up against a dance master by checking the ranking of the player they want to challenge. With over 70 songs, some great new modes, and online play, DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION EXTREME 2 is yet another great DDR game.",Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2,http://www.ign.com/games/dance-dance-revolution-extreme-2/ps2-746768,http://ps2.ign.com/articles/655/655271p1.html,39.99 USD,7.5,PS2,"September 27, 2005","http://www.ign.com/games/amplitude/ps2-17285,http://www.ign.com/games/guitar-hero-ii/ps2-823033,http://www.ign.com/games/guitar-hero-iii-legends-of-rock/ps2-899095,http://www.ign.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4/ps2-14241813,http://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ii/ps2-811719,http://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ii/ps2-888576",Great,8.4,"Mild Lyrics, Suggestive Themes",E10+ for Everyone 10 and older,Good

Activision,"Third-Person, Action",Treyarch,"ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN is Activision's third SPIDER-MAN game and the first to be based off the comics rather than the new movies. The PC game puts players in control of the web-slinging Spider-Man as he does battle with Venom and other enemies while getting help from some familiar superheroes. The story of Spider-Man begins when 15 year old Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider. He soon realizes he has the ability to climb walls and to sense things. Shortly after being bitten, Peter and friend Eddie Brock discover a mysterious black suit that their fathers created before their deaths. Eddie ends up putting on the suit, which turns him into the powerful villain known as Venom. Peter must battle his childhood friend and other villains like the Green Goblin, Carnage, and Electro to save the city. In story mode, players can walk around New York City as much as they wish as they accomplish side-missions or move the plot along. Instead of walking, though, Spider-Man can shoot webs onto tall buildings and swing his way around the city while capturing gang members and stopping crimes. He also must stop Venom's plot and defeat the other villains. Players will also enjoy seeing Spider-Man joined by allies like Wolverine and the Human Torch for some scenes.

The changes to the isomotion system are the biggest gameplay tweak gamers will find in NBA 2K6. The turbo button no longer exists. Instead, gamers can use the right and left buttons to modify their players aggression, which can change how the player passes and shoots. These changes include how fast the player is moving, what kind of fakes he does, and how he passes. Jukes have also been tweaked a bit, making them easier to chain together and more life-like. All of these changes make the game much more realistic and allow players to move more like they do in real basketball games. The shoot stick feature, also, makes it easier to shoot and makes the game look more realistic. With just a flick of the control stick, gamers can unleash a quick jump shot, a dunk, or a fast layup. Plenty of players are available in NBA 2K6. Just about every NBA team is represented, as are hundreds of today's hottest players like Shaq, Steve Nash, and Amare Stoudemire.

The PS2 Limited Edition puts players in control of the web-slinging Spider-Man as he does battle with Venom and other enemies while getting help from some familiar superheroes. The story of Spider-Man begins when 15 year old Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider. He soon realizes he has the ability to climb walls and to sense things. Shortly after being bitten, Peter and friend Eddie Brock discover a mysterious black suit that their fathers created before their deaths. Eddie ends up putting on the suit, which turns him into the powerful villain known as Venom. Peter must battle his childhood friend and other villains like the Green Goblin, Carnage, and Electro to save the city. In story mode, players can walk around New York City as much as they wish as they accomplish side-missions or move the plot along. Instead of walking, though, Spider-Man can shoot webs onto tall buildings and swing his way around the city while capturing gang members and stopping crimes. He also must stop Venom's plot and defeat the other villains. Players will also enjoy seeing Spider-Man joined by allies like Wolverine and the Human Torch for some scenes.

With new features like isomotion, amazing graphics, and very realistic physics and player movement, the 2006 addition to the series is one of the best. The changes to the isomotion system are the biggest gameplay tweak gamers will find in NBA 2K6. The turbo button no longer exists. Instead, gamers can use the right and left buttons to modify their players aggression, which can change how the player passes and shoots. These changes include how fast the player is moving, what kind of fakes he does, and how he passes. Jukes have also been tweaked a bit, making them easier to chain together and more life-like. All of these changes make the game much more realistic and allow players to move more like they do in real basketball games. The shoot stick feature, also, makes it easier to shoot and makes the game look more realistic. With just a flick of the control stick, gamers can unleash a quick jump shot, a dunk, or a fast layup. Plenty of players are available in NBA 2K6. Just about every NBA team is represented, as are hundreds of today's hottest players like Shaq, Steve Nash, and Amare Stoudemire.

A demolition racer, the game gives players the twin directives of not only winning the race but taking down a good number of the other cars while doing it. Players begin the game by selecting one of 21 different cars, some of which are only available after unlocking them. Then they hit the course, aiming to outrace all of the other drivers in either a tournament or quick race. That's where the demolition part of the game comes into play. Players can run other cars off the road, crash into them, or make them crash into obstacles.

The game has 22 different courses, each incredibly detailed and full of objects for cars to crash into. These courses span the world and include six different international locations, each recreated in stunning graphics.

Tecmo,"Turn-Based, Strategy",Tecmo,"Tecmo presents TRAPT for the PS2, a puzzle-based game that contains a number of horror elements in its interesting storyline. The game is a continuation of the KAGERO: Deception series that began on the Playstation, but players aren't required to play the original games to understand TRAPT. The storyline begins when Princess Allura is framed for killing her father. As she flees the castle, players learn her dark secret: she's possessed by a demon known as Fiend. Fiend allows Allura to set a number of different traps to kill people, giving Fiend souls to survive off of. As the storyline progresses, players learn more about Fiend and how he came to possess the princess. The gameplay in TRAPT is very unique. As Allura, players run around the room setting traps while avoiding enemies. Once up to nine traps are set, they can be activated once an enemy is near. The traps come in a number of different types, including floor traps like bombs, wall traps like spikes, and ceiling traps like metal balls. Once players understand the system, they can start laying out traps in a way that an enemy will be hit by several at once to create a combo. Of course, it isn't quite that simple: some enemies are immune to certain traps, and some rooms contain areas where traps can't be placed. TRAPT weaves together unique characters, horror elements, and a fun, different gameplay style to create a unique game that will provide hours of challenge.",TЯAPT,http://www.ign.com/games/trapt/ps2-690627,http://ps2.ign.com/articles/657/657604p1.html,49.99 USD,7.5,PS2 PS3,"November 1, 2005","http://www.ign.com/games/yu-gi-oh-gx-the-beginning-of-destiny/ps2-951226,http://www.ign.com/games/disgaea-1/ps2-535848,http://www.ign.com/games/front-mission-4/ps2-573997,http://www.ign.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4/ps2-14241813,http://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ii/ps2-811719,http://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ii/ps2-888576",Good,7.6,"Blood, Violence",M for Mature,Good

Activision,"First-Person, Shooter",WXP Inc.,"Paintball professional Greg Hasting's returns in Activision's GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D for the Xbox, the sequel to GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL. The second game in the series includes a number of paintball pros, different modes, and a level editor. Like the previous game, GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D includes a number of different gameplay modes. Players work as part of a team (either AI-controlled or with friends) to take down the opposing team in a number of different environments. The single-player campaign mode takes it a step further, putting players in charge of forming a paintball team from a number of unknowns and turning them into paintball champions. Along the way, players will face off against big-name paintball players, including Nicky Cuba, Matt Marshall, Peter Utsching, and, eventually, Greg Hasting himself. Between tournaments, players can purchase new equipment for their characters and spend accumulated skill points to increase their statistics. The biggest addition to MAX'D is the level editor. This allows gamers to create their own paintball arenas ranging from small to large, cluttered to open. Players can add bunkers, rocks, trees, picnic tables, and many other items to the field.

Enlight,"Economic, Simulation",,"Fans of simulation games will be please to add MARINE PARK EMPIRE by Enlight for the PC to their list of must haves. This is because the game not only focuses the attention on being able to understand the economics of the situation and the responsibility of owning an animal theme park. One of the greatest difficulties of owning an animal theme park is the fact that players must learn how to balance the cost of running a clean and healthy park for the animals against what they need to do to make such a venture exciting and successful. One large consideration that players must work around when building their park are the habitats for their animals, and the game helps them accomplish this by setting up specific guidelines for each animal. After starting things up, players will need to work until it becomes a thriving business while completing a variety of goals set out for them by the game. The graphics in MARINE PARK EMPIRE are colorful and engaging and are sure to bring players even further into the world that they are creating. This not only helps gamers to better understand what they're building, it also makes the game quite enjoyable for a range of ages and backgrounds. It is certainly not difficult to set up and play, and its use of beautiful animals makes it good for younger players.
