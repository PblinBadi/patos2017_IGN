Each character has a basic light and heavy attack plus throws and a unique slam attack that they can use once they build up enough power by hitting their foes. Each character also has specific strengths and weaknesses that will impact how players battle with them. Players can also grab weapons that appear on each level and use them against their opponents. There are a number of different modes in the game, including the single-player story mode, tutorial mode, multiplayer mode, and the mega challenge mode. Story mode allows players to unlock more characters, stages, and alternate outfits for the fighters. Challenge mode presents players with a challenge race, a number of items to collect, etc that they must accomplish before their opponents do.

As the name implies, this isn't a normal racing game; players will have to watch out for environmental hazards like lava and boulders while guarding against homing missiles, attack drones, and other weapons unleashed by the other racers. The story of JAK X weaves together several different plots that began in the previous games. Krew, a villain from JAK II, is dead, and Jak and Dexter are asked to attend the reading of his will along with Sig, Ashelin, Krew's daughter Rayn, and others. One of Krew's requests is that everyone drink a toast in his honor; however, the wine is poisoned The rest of Krew's instructions are then revealed: if any of the characters can win the Kras City Grand Championship in his name, they will be given the antidote. With no choice in the matter, the group enters the race, but soon, each is vying to win no matter what. The game features four different cups consisting of 20 challenges each, plus a large number of unlockable extras like more tracks, car upgrades, new racers, and more.

Sony Computer Entertainment,Action,Insomniac Games,"Insomniac Games brings back one of its most beloved characters in Ratchet: Deadlocked. Ratchet: Deadlocked begins shortly after the end of Ratchet & Clank: Up your Arsenal. The three heroes, Ratchet, Clank, and mechanic Al, have just finished their latest mission when they are captured by galactic villain Gleeman Vox. Vox plans to use the heroes as part of his reality TV arena show, Dreadzone, where heroes are forced to fight each other to the end.

The major difference in Ratchet: Deadlocked is that Clank is no longer on Ratchet's back. Instead, he will occasionally supply Ratchet with a necessary gadget. This takes out many of the platformer elements of the series, leaving Ratchet to mostly battle his way through the eleven different Dreadzone levels with the help of two combat bots. Gamers can find a number of different weapons and gadgets throughout the game, including the incredibly destructive Harbinger gun.

With the focus more on coaching instead of playing with big-name stars, COLLEGE HOOPS 2K6 puts the player in charge of an NCAA team of their own. Gamers can select from nearly every NCAA coach currently in the industry or create their own. Each coach has a number of different attributes, and these attributes will determine many different aspects of the game. Charisma, for example, affects recruitment and player confidence, while discipline will help players focus on the game. Players may also bring issues to the coach to solve, which also affects the team's playing ability as well. Gamers will also have access to the coach's clipboard during the game. The clipboard will pop up automatically when gamers need to make adjustments instead of requiring gamers to access a series of menus. Another new feature are the four points of emphasis: ball control, defense, rebounding, and shot selection.

As relentless Air Force pilots in JETFIGHTER 2015 by Global Star for the PC, players will need to make sure that they stop the terrorist activities before they gather up enough forces to strike America. Since JETFIGHTER 2015 takes place in the future, the technology of the planes that players are flying has greatly increased to where players can switch between two different modes of flight: hover and jet.

Featuring the same great monkey-catching setup as the previous two games, APE ESCAPE 3 focuses more on the humor of the series and adds tons of extras, mini-games, and monkeys. The evil monkey Specter is back, and this time, he's teamed up with a human scientist, Doctor Tomoko, to create a series of crazy TV shows that will turn all of humanity into mush-brained couch potatoes. Even Jimmy, Spike, and the professor, the heroes of the previous games, are mesmerized by the silly shows, leaving only young Kei and his sister Yumi to deal with Specter and his band of monkeys. Players can choose to play as either Kei or Yumi, although both have the same equipment and basic moves. Once again, the goal of the game is to enter a level, track down the monkeys, and capture them in a net. There are 400 monkeys to catch, a record number, and they are spread across levels reminiscent of the wild west, the Arabian desert, and a frozen wasteland. Fortunately, the duo has a number of powerful, though goofy, gadgets to use to catch the monkeys. As with the previous games, what really makes APE ESCAPE 3 stand out is the monkey's personalities.

Namco,RPG,Namco Tales Studio,"The Tales Of series by Nintendo has proven to be one of the more popular role playing game series, spawning hits like TALES OF LEGENDIA, but the original game, TALES OF PHANTASIA, has never been released in the US until now. Originally a Super Famicom (Super Nintendo) game, TALES OF PHANTASIA has been reborn on the Game Boy Advance. The game follows Cress, a young boy who finds his life completely changed after a hunting trip with his friend. He ends up leaving his home on a quest to right past wrongs and learn about the history of his world. As with all RPGs, Cress meets up with several other characters during his quest, leading to the player controlling a party of different characters through much of the game. Battles in TALES OF PHANTASIA aren't the traditional turn-based fights that most RPGs use. Instead, players can make Cress perform different attacks by pressing the D-pad. Players can also chain together attacks and, as Cress levels up, learn new moves to use.

Players are put in the role of a rookie cop in a new division of the Capital City police force. Headed by a old, crotchety chief, players will be sent on missions to apprehend the five different gangs of the city. Each gang has their own unique look, vehicles, and areas of the city, so players will be introduced to a variety of different villains throughout the game. Most missions begin with players behind the wheel of a motorcycle, car, boat, or other vehicle in pursuit of or searching for members of the gangs. Once the gang members have been cornered, the game shifts into shooter mode. Players have a good number of weapons to shoot from, including some explosive ones that can actually destroy gang cars. This is a viable option to taking out the gang members themselves, since the game rarely requires them be taken alive. In addition to the story mode, there are also racing modes and time trial modes for players to master.

Electronic Arts,"Real-Time, Strategy",EA Los Angeles,"It is unusual for a pre-established series like The Lord of the Rings to successfully take on a sequel, but EA Game's LORD OF THE RINGS: THE BATTLE FOR MIDDLE EARTH II for the PC proved this theory wrong. This game manages to take the well-known mythology surrounding the story and focused on the war in the North between the elves, dwarves, goblins, and Mordor forces that is only touched upon in the book and is left out completely in the movies. LORD OF THE RINGS: THE BATTLE FOR MIDDLE EARTH II plays out much like the game of Risk in that players must move their armies around a board that is covered in territories. Players will find that this new battle between good and evil takes place on a much grander scale with six different factions combining to against the forces of Mordor. Players can also combine forces in multiplayer mode to get the most out of the fights. This ability to customize the fighting options makes for a great game no matter what type of mood the player is in.
