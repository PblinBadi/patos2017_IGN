In Worms: Open Warfare, players command an army of worms into battle against others, and try to take them out by employing an array of lethal and quirky weaponry. The game features traditional weapons, such as grenades, pistols and rocket launchers, as well as non-traditional arms and gadgets including a sheep launcher. Each worm has health points, and by successfully using weapons players can take out the individual worm threat by whittling down their heath. Watch out, though - these worms are pushovers, and if an innocent worm gets in the way of a defeated worm, they could potentially take damage from the impending explosion a worm gets in with his dying breath. The game supports hot potato and wireless link multiplay for up to four (using one cartridge).",Worms: Open Warfare,http://www.ign.com/games/worms-open-warfare/nds-760120,http://ds.ign.com/articles/698/698661p1.html,29.99 USD,6.0,NDS PSP,"March 20, 2006","http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-conquest/nds-125156,http://www.ign.com/games/advance-wars-dual-strike/nds-707311,http://www.ign.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/nds-84432,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-black-version-2/nds-129224,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-conquest/nds-125156,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-white-version-2/nds-129228",Okay,6.6,"Language, Mild Cartoon Violence",E10+ for Everyone 10 and older,Okay

2K Sports,Sports,,"Head to the court and compete against some of the biggest names in tennis with 2K Sports' TOP SPIN 2 for the Nintendo DS. The game contains exciting tennis gameplay, a number of different modes, some use of the DS touch screen, and a lot of fun. Career mode, the main mode of the game, has players creating a male or female character from scratch using the game's fairly deep customization mode. Once their player is created and named, gamers move to the court. First comes several training rounds with the coach, who will teach players everything then need to know about controlling their character, serving, and returning the ball in TOP SPIN 2. However, each lesson costs money, so players will need to quickly enter a low-level tournament to earn some cash. Many of the tournaments won't be available at the beginning, but as players win matches and earn rankings, more difficult tournaments will open up. Eventually, players will find themselves facing off against big name tennis stars like Andy Roddick, Venus Williams, Roger Federer, Maria Sharapova, Lindsay Davenport, and Lleyton Hewitt. Gamers can also play quick games as either singles or doubles, play an exhibition match, play three different mini-games in party mode, and take on friends via wireless connection.
