Playful Entertainment,Card,,"Jungle Speed is a twitchy, fast-paced card game for WiiWare that's fun for all ages. With a jungle character seated comfortably at the game table, players are each dealt a pile of cards. Play starts when the first person flips their card. Moving around the table symbols are revealed until two of the exposed cards match. Players with the matching cards must then scramble to grasp the totem in the middle of the table. The faster player then gives their cards to their unfortunate adversary. With paws flying, the first person to get rid of all their cards wins the game.

Jungle Speed also offers simultaneous play for up to eight players. Each remote and nunchuk pair can support two players at a time, making it a great game for get-togethers.

Perfect World Entertainment,"Persistent Online, RPG",Perfect World Entertainment,"In the beginning of time, the first God of the universe, Pan Gu, lived an immortal life. With his divine power, Pan Gu forged the elements into air, land, mountains, rivers, seas, and plant life -- and laid the foundation for a new world. It was then that Pan Gu made his first attempt to fill this new world with life. But these unnamed creatures were uncivilized, and before long, they began turning on one another and corrupting the world around them. Pan Gu saw that what he had created had become an Imperfect World, and moved quickly to rectify his mistake.

After cleansing the world, Pan Gu once again attempted to populate it, this time with beings capable of Spiritual Cultivation. He created three races that possessed the traits he most treasured in himself. The chief quality that Pan Gu gave all three races was free will. He vowed never again to eradicate an entire species, so all conflicts between the races were to be resolved amongst themselves. Despite their clashes of culture and territory, these Humans, Winged Elves and Untamed beings formed Pan Gu's Perfect World. But the balance is about to be tested, as the imperfect creatures thought to be wiped out are now emerging to destroy the world...

=Tempelhof, Berlin, dawn of 8th April 1949=

A major armed conflict is brewing between the Western powers and the Soviet bloc. The Red Army has been growing ever stronger since the end of World War II. With the growth of their army the Soviets realize that they hold the advantage, and are only waiting for the right moment to attack. That moment arrives with the Tempelhof Incident: the near-fatal collision of a US cargo plane and a Soviet fighter over Berlin's main airfield. A fatal combination of coincidence and human error, there is no point in arguing what went wrong, no point in asking who pulled the trigger first and who fired on whom in return. The Incident went down in history as fatal.

What if Stalin knew exactly that the USA cannot produce more A-bombs after the war? What if he decides to strike first? The massive Russian army was still standing in the middle of Europe and its dependancy on western technology was past -- it was ready to roll towards the Atlantic ocean on the first sign from the Boss. The fate of the world was in the hands of a ruthless dictator, who would have shown no sign of hesitation if he knew the proper status of the atomic arsenal in the western world...In this game the worst comes true, and it may just change the fate of the ""free world"" forever!

In Flock, players take control of an alien UFO that is tasked with herding animals to its mothership through a variety of interactive levels. Players will have to overcome the stubbornness of the temperamental beasts (this may require the use of fear, or amorous yearnings, etc.), as well as a series of environmental puzzles that must be solved using Flock's physics-based gameplay. By finding or making a passable route, players can herd the animals safely toward the ship. Solving the puzzles within the suggested time limit yields exciting rewards. But players can also take their time to find more hidden bonuses.

Flock uses a sophisticated physics engine that drives the challenging puzzle elements of the game. Whether it's using the Tractor beam to move obstacles out of the way, or the Depressor beam to stamp out crop circles to guide your herds, being an extraterrestrial has never been this addictive.

cdv Software Entertainment,RPG,Ascaron Entertainment,"T Energy has been flowing through Ancaria since time itself. This mysterious power forms the beginning of all life, is the source of all magic and the origin of all thought. For an era, it was the angelic Seraphim who watched over the T Energy and therefore over the fate of the entire world. They passed their knowledge on to the High Elves, so that they could benefit from T Energy. But the High Elves let the power over T Energy tear their society apart, and war and strife broke out. Worse than that, the T Energy itself went out of control, turning negative and creating destructive evil in the land.

The nobility as well as the clerical caste of the High Elves struggled to seize power over the high-elvish imperium, so that they alone might hold the T Power in their rule. The land once more faced with war; a war that was much larger, and more far reaching consequences than all previous wars and battles. Two thousand years before Shaddar the cry for heroes arises to avert this war and to regain control over the T Energy.
