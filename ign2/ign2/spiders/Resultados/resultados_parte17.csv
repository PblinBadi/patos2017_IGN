This time, the game focuses on Spyro's childhood and recounts the story of his first major battle with Cinder the Dragon. The game begins with Spyro hatching out of an egg and being raised by dragonflies. He has no idea that he's a dragon, but once Spyro discovers this, he will have access to many of his dragon talents, including fire breathing and flying. He will need all of these abilities to take down the evil black dragon Cinder, who is plotting to resurrect an evil force and take over the world. A New Beginning focuses more on battle than platforming. Spyro's breath attack can be modified with elemental powers, and each of these four elements has three different attacks that Spyro can access once he collects enough gems. Each attack has its own uses. In addition to elemental blasts, Spyro also has access to one fury move per element. These moves damage enemies across the entire screen. The flying levels work just like aerial shooters, with Spyro blasting his way through Cinder's flying forces while dodging and spiraling out of the way of incoming blasts.

Players can also use the DS touch screen controls to move Spyro and attack enemies. The game begins with Spyro hatching out of an egg and being raised by dragonflies.

He will need all of these abilities to take down the evil dragon Cinder, who is plotting to take over the world. Spyro's breath attack can be modified with elemental powers, and each of these four elements has three different attacks that Spyro can access once he collects enough gems. Each attack has its own uses. In addition to elemental blasts, Spyro also has access to fury moves that damage all enemies on the screen. The flying levels work just like aerial shooters, with Spyro blasting his way through Cinder's flying forces while dodging and spiraling out of the way of incoming blasts.
