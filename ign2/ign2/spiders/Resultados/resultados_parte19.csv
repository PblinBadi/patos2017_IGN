This landmark action-puzzle game has been a worldwide fixture in video games from the moment of its inception until today, producing many sequels and related products along the way. The player controls the hero, or ""Runner,"" who collects gold nuggets located around every stage, all the while avoiding capture by enemy robots. The action itself is simple, but the stages are designed as increasingly challenging puzzles, and none of the 50 stages is as easy as it seems. The Runner avoids enemies by digging holes in the floor to the right and left of his position—by doing this, he can clear a path to places that, at first glance, seem unreachable. Players must use their brains to collect all the gold nuggets in every puzzling stage if they want to escape to the next.

He buys a vast plot of land at the outskirts of the town to create a grand dungeon in hopes of luring in various enemy monsters which to hunt to collect gold and items.  He envisions his complete dungeon to be one so appealing as to lure the legendary Wandering Demon.  Defeating this menacing monster would free the townspeople from the fear he casts upon them, while winning acclaim as a true dungeon maker for the ""Architect.""

The townspeople are initially skeptical about the Architect's ability to achieve his ultimate goal of building such a dungeon.  Over the years, they've watched other such dungeon makers arrive with great plans but ultimately fail -- falling prey to the very monsters they've lured into their dungeons or haphazardly abandoning their creations.  However, as the Architect's dungeon grows and improves, luring rarer and more powerful enemies, and he begins bringing back more valuable treasures, the townspeople begin offering support to his mission.  Soon the whole town is involved in the dungeon making process; they give advice about the intricacies of dungeon making, sell crucial items, provide weapons and magic spells, treat the Architect when injured, and request various favors to be completed in the expanding dungeon in exchange for generous rewards.

Whether the growing hopes of the townspeople and the Architect will be realized all depends on the quality of the dungeon he creates and his developing battle skills.",Dungeon Maker: Hunting Ground,http://www.ign.com/games/dungeon-maker-hunting-ground/psp-845206,http://psp.ign.com/articles/797/797896p1.html,39.99 USD,6.4,PSP,"June 19, 2007","http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/psp-14340290,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/psp-33571,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-origins/psp-118656,http://www.ign.com/games/armored-core-3/psp-14340849,http://www.ign.com/games/susume-tactics/psp-68648,http://www.ign.com/games/warship-gunner-2/psp-32980,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/psp-14340290,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/psp-33571,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/psp-18950",Good,7.4,"Fantasy Violence, Mild Suggestive Themes",E10+ for Everyone 10 and older,Okay

Led by Pompolic, these armies of demonic hordes quickly overran most (but not all) of the planet. The evil is spreading its power via his servants -- the Dark Souls. These Dark Souls - protected by a horde of monsters - are poisoning the minds of his victims and making them slaves of evil. The denizens of this world are on the edge of total annihilation. However, a little hope still exists in the heart of the remaining citizens. They believe that there are brave hearts who can save the world from the source of the evil power. If the Dark Souls were to be captured, the onslaught would stop, and Pompolic would be defeated; the call for heroes is made...

The times when a traveler could pass through the lands without fear are gone. Now at every step there are hordes of monsters with one purpose: to protect the Dark Souls by slaying anyone who is not a follower of darkness. But a great warrior with strong will, faith, and mighty weapons may succeed in defeating them.

Electronic Arts,Sports,EA Canada,"When the game is on the line and the ball is in your hands, what will you do? Will you penetrate, drive the lane and rise above the rim for a monster dunk, or find an opening on the perimeter and sink a game-winning three? Take control of the game with a full arsenal to win the one-on-one match-up from every spot on the floor with NBA Live 08.

Taking a page out of NBA STREET Homecourt's book, NBA Live 08 introduces Quickstrike Ballhandling. This intuitive gameplay mechanic is mapped to the right analog stick and gives you the direct responsiveness you need to perform a full repertoire of ankle-breaking ball-handling moves that let you dominate on the perimeter. Pass the ball inside and win in the post with all-new 'own the paint' post play for the big men down low. Use the new shot-countershot control to string together combos of fakes and shots to fool your defender into committing and create space for the game-defining bucket. On the perimeter, in the paint, and with complete authenticity to the sport of basketball, dominate with your go-to move with NBA LIVE 08.",NBA Live 08,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-live-2008/ps3-900781,http://ps3.ign.com/articles/824/824860p1.html,59.99 USD,6.9,PS3 Wii Xbox 360 Cell PC PS2 PSP,"October 2, 2007","http://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-2013/ps3-128098,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k17/ps3-20052297,http://www.ign.com/games/fifa-2013/ps3-115679,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/ps3-20006859,http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-online-mgs5/ps3-20028682,http://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-dragonborn/ps3-146419",Good,7.5,,E for Everyone,Okay
