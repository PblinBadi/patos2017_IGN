Admiral Perry has just opened Japan's borders to the British, allowing for a long-overdue globalization process to begin. Unfortunately, one of the open ports happens to be a modest Japanese burg called Amihama, where a resistance group known as the ""Disciples of Prajna"" have taken up arms against the arriving foreigners and all who support them.

As a lone samurai who's just arrived amidst the chaos, it's up to you whether you want to join forces with the Prajna resistance, fight alongside the foreigners in the name of progress or take your stance somewhere between the two by supporting the local government's attempts to quell the violence (through any means possible).",Acquire,Action,5.5,Mediocre,PS3 PC,39.99 USD,Xseed Games,M for Mature,,"http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/ps3-20006859,http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-online-mgs5/ps3-20028682,http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-5/ps3-149839,http://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-black-flag/ps3-161486,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/ps3-20594,http://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-freedom-cry/ps3-20009405,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/ps3-20006859,http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-online-mgs5/ps3-20028682,http://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-dragonborn/ps3-146419","August 21, 2012",http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/03/way-of-the-samurai-4-review,Way of the Samurai 4,http://www.ign.com/games/way-of-the-samurai-4/ps3-23516
