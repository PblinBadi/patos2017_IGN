7.8,Good,"Lionhead Studios and EA Games took players into a magical world with the hit real time strategy game Black & White. Now Mac gamers can experience all of the action from the original BLACK & WHITE plus the expansion pack Creature Isle in the Black & White Platinum Pack.

In Black & White, gamers create their own monster to serve as the primary commander of their forces. The interesting part of Black & White, and the aspect of the game referenced in the title, is that players can make their creature either good or bad. The world of Black & White is based on belief, and each action a player makes either adds white or black to their belief color. Gamers can either turn their creature to the white side by protecting citizens and helping villagers or to the dark side by destroying towns and terrorizing everyone. As belief builds, other characters in the game start treating the creature differently. The game begins with players in one city. They must direct their creatures to perform various miracles and other actions and, from time to time, overcome the challenges thrown at them by the other gods of the realm. The goal is to gain enough power to rule over the entire city.

In addition to the single player game, Black & White Platinum Pack also features LAN and internet play, offering gamers unlimited adventures in a land full of monsters and magic.",Lionhead Studios,Compilation,9.7,Amazing,Mac,29.99 USD,Feral Interactive,T for Teen,"Comic Mischief, Violence","http://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-deluxe-edition/mac-818892,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy/mac-86141,http://www.ign.com/games/playrix-platinum-pack/mac-59135,http://www.ign.com/games/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition/mac-20037340,http://www.ign.com/games/divinity-original-sin/mac-135173,http://www.ign.com/games/elder-scrolls-online/mac-133733","Jan 1, 2003",http://mac.ign.com/articles/390/390019p1.html,Black & White -- Platinum Pack
