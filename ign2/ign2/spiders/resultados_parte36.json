Heroes of the Storm is a team-based competitive game in which each player controls a powerful hero with unique abilities, and works with his or her team to invade and destroy the enemy team's base.\n\nOver the course of a match, waves of computer-controlled creatures for each team advance automatically across the map along different pathways. Players fight alongside these creatures to advance the battlefront, destroy enemy towers, and eventually push into the enemy base. Other points of interest are guarded by neutral hostile creatures; capturing and controlling these points grants bonuses to your team. As your team kills computer-controlled creatures and other players, your hero will gain experience and levels to strengthen his or her special abilities. You'll also earn gold which you can use to purchase upgrades and items to customize and improve your hero over the course of a match.", "platforms": "Mac PC", "ign_score": "6.5", "ign_score_phrase": "Okay", "community_score": "9.0", "community_score_phrase": "Amazing", "review_link": "http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/02/heroes-of-the-storm-review", "related_games": ["http://www.ign.com/games/prison-architect/mac-145353", "http://www.ign.com/games/xcom-2/mac-20038028", "http://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-3/mac-20069059", "http://www.ign.com/games/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition/mac-20037340", "http://www.ign.com/games/divinity-original-sin/mac-135173", "http://www.ign.com/games/elder-scrolls-online/mac-133733"], "release_date": "June 2, 2015", "rating_category": "T for Teen", "rating_content": "Crude Humor, Fantasy Violence, Mild Blood, Mild Language, Mild Suggestive Themes, Includes online features that may expose players to unrated user-generated content", "genres": "Real-Time, Strategy", "publisher": "Blizzard Entertainment", "developers": "Blizzard Entertainment"},

The fearsome Empire of Nilfgaard has struck again, ravaging the hapless Northern Kingdoms. The once-mighty who tried to use Geralt for their own gain are now gone. In these uncertain times, no one can say what fortune holds in store, who will bring peace to the world and who will cause it only misery. But a force darker and deadlier emerges. The petty men and women commanding tin-plated armies fail to understand that their conflict is child's play compared to the Wild Hunt, the otherworldly threat which now looms. These ghastly spectral riders have for ages plagued humankind, bringing misery to the world. Yet this time the Wild Hunt seeks one person in particular: the one individual Destiny itself bestowed upon Geralt, the one soul Geralt considers kin.\n\nThe climactic third game in the fantasy RPG series, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a unique combination of a non-linear story and an open world -- a character-driven, non-linear story experience focused on player choice, tactical combat and a rich, living environment. This world is populated with intelligent inhabitants and animated by new mechanics that make it a dynamic, living, breathing place. As players travel the world, witnessing many a sunrise or sunset, enduring torrential rains or sweltering heat, they see predators hunting their prey, villages defending themselves against monsters, lovers meeting by moonlight. The new in-game economy system varies the price of goods based on surrounding conditions or their place of origin, encouraging players to seek out through hunting and collecting items that are in demand. With a re-envisioned approach to the narrative, the game will be accessible to both newcomers and old time fans, and a tutorial eases players into the game. Combat has been redesigned in order to combine traditional RPG elements with the speed and precision of a dedicated fighting game.
