DreamCatcher Interactive,Adventure,Revolution Software Ltd.,"A mysterious compound known as Blue Nephiline has been discovered in the former Soviet Republic of Volgia.

The game itself is set in 2015 when, presumably, the Typhoon will be in standard service across several nations in Europe. In this particular case, you'll be defending Iceland from a Russian invasion. The game features simplified controls to make the gameplay more accessible to action fans and a dynamic campaign mode. It begins with several missions surrounding an attempt by the Russians to secure a beachhead. At this stage, you'll need to strike enemy ships and intercept incoming cruise missiles. Once the Russians do gain a footing you'll need to fly missions involving bomber interception and ground support.

You choose whether you want your brawler to specialize in power, speed, or a combination of the two more powerful characters can inflict serious damage with one or two blows, while the speedier combatants are more readily able to avoid attacks and string together wicked combos. Choosing the combination of speed and power gives you unbelievable offensive skills, but saddles you with the burden of operating with less stamina.

This clears the stage and advances you to the next level. There's no time to rest though, as each successive round of sphere-blasting fun is more difficult than the last.
