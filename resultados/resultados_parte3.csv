O.D.T. features four playable characters, (a wizard, a female fighter, a soldier or a mercenary), each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Depending on which character a player selects, the gaming outcome may vary. For example, the wizard, who may not possess the maneuvering skills of the mercenary, may need to find an alternative route around an area that the mercenary could scale with ease. Likewise, a mercenary may have trouble dealing with an obstacle that requires a magical presence, in which case the wizard would be very beneficial.

In CHAMELEON TWIST 2 his trip isn't any easier this time than it was in the first game. Luckily he's still got his multipurpose tongue, which serves as both a weapon and a mode of travel. When his enemies get a little too close he can roll out his tongue and let loose with Single Spit, Shishkabob, or Machine Gun attacks. If the action gets too hot, Davy can always wrap his tongue around him like armor, or he can beat a hasty retreat by simply reaching out with his oversized tongue and swinging out of the scene. New options available in CHAMELEON TWIST 2 include parasol gliding, which can keep you out of harm's way or put you smack dab in the middle of the action.

This game became an instant hit, largely due to its simplicity: Players remove matching pairs of tiles from an organized heap, trying to remove as many tiles as possible. Now the game returns, in color, portable, and expanded, on the Atari Lynx. As in the original Shanghai, you are presented with 144 mah-jongg tiles arranged in an organized, three-dimensional heap. By selecting matching pairs of ""free"" tiles (tiles not blocked by other tiles to the left or right), you whittle down the pile, and ultimately -- if your strategy is wise -- clear the heap.

Virtua Circus, it would seem, aims to kill off all smaller circuses, and monopolize the business. Starshot, an upstart juggler in the debt-riddled smaller troupe, takes off to visit far-away planets to get ideas for new acts; the hope being that these acts will help get the circus back in the black. Each land that Starshot visits is a vast level, with several missions and tons of interesting alien characters. As with most video games, our hero can jump, run, shoot, and fly. Unlike most video games, the object isn't necessarily to kill the enemies. Sometimes an enemy is more like a puzzle that needs to be solved than a scary thing that wants to kill you. Some of these puzzles are so intricate; they almost take on the roll of a series of mini-games with weapons or power-ups as rewards.

There are lots of trick spaces that give you advantages or disadvantages, like the Spike the Dog spot (which allows you to ride the pet for five spaces), and a Dil spot (which makes Dil come out and shuffle the board).

4.5,Bad,"Cherry Master is a slot machine consisting of nine independent reels, which can make up a total of eight lines, three horizontal and vertical lines, and two diagonal lines. There are two different modes, an Original Mode and a Simple Mode. The latter omits the game bonuses, name entry and ability to save high scores. Apart from regular settings, which let you enjoy the slot machine gameplay with normal rules, there is also the more advanced Pro Stage that gives players access to machine settings, adding quick stops, different double-ups and higher bets. Place your bet, hit a button and stop the reels at the right time to win more credits. There are eight lines, A through H. Numbers next to the letters increase (to a maximum of 8) as bets on lines are made. When pictures are lined up, the total below one of the bonus categories found on the right side of the screen decreases.

Some additional hypothetical battles are also included. Fighting Steel is set in real time and includes a 3D interface as well as map screens for plotting fleet course and for supplying orders. This interface, which is somewhat reminiscent of Jane's Fleet Command, makes the game a little more like a naval simulation than a full-fledged strategic war game, but this is a good blend of both worlds. The biggest downside to this style of 2D/3D interface is that it can be terribly confusing even to an experienced war gamer or simulation buff.

8.6,Great,"Midway returns to the gridiron with NFL BLITZ 2000 for the Nintendo 64.  The game is an upgrade from the arcade version of NFL BLITZ '99, as there are numerous additions that make it much more exciting. You can play with up to four players (two on defense, two on offense) and write your own plays that can be used right away, or saved for later. NFL BLITZ 2000 has much more speed and far fewer rules than some of the other football games available, resulting in a fresh and fun new look at the NFL. As in the arcade version, every team and all players are faithfully represented.  This new version adds an ""On Fire"" mode, which allows players who have caught three consecutive passes to gain a special unlimited ""turbo"" feature, allowing the player to run faster than the opposition, a distinct advantage. For anyone who likes to recreate games with their favorite teams without a lot of rules, NFL BLITZ 2000 is the perfect solution!",Midway  Games,Sports,9.2,Amazing,N64 PS DC PC GBC,12 USD,Midway  Games,E for Everyone,"Animated Violence, Mild Language","http://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/n64-14169,http://www.ign.com/games/mario-golf/n64-10628,http://www.ign.com/games/international-superstar-soccer-2000/n64-15240,http://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-64/n64-502,http://www.ign.com/games/star-fox-64/n64-419,http://www.ign.com/games/diddy-kong-racing/n64-2146,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933","August 17, 1999",http://ign64.ign.com/articles/160/160212p1.html,NFL Blitz 2000,http://www.ign.com/games/nfl-blitz-2000/n64-10212

8.0,Great,"EA Sports continues to improve the motion-captured animation and framerate quality with MADDEN NFL 2000. They've added refinements and new features that give you the sense that you're watching an authentic televised NFL game, not playing a videogame. Just scored a touchdown or made an interception? Television-style camera shots will cut away to celebratory sideline reactions. You can also use the Coach Cam to preview individual player assignments. Included in the usual long list of options is route-based passing, which lets the quarterback lead the receiver. Players carrying the ball can also draw upon a newly revamped list of maneuvers. Work with eight basic offensive formations and six defensive formations to put your own personal stamp on the game. You also have control over frequency of injuries, weather conditions, quarter lengths, and game speed. You can even program how the referees call the penalties!  Quarterback accuracy, blocking ability, and run or pass ratios it's all up to you.
