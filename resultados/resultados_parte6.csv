When three or more tiles link up in a up/down or left/right fashion, they disappear.

It's up to you to continuously work the bin to wipe out tiles by making combination connections and chain reactions. That's the game in a nutshell, but there are several modes of play that'll keep your fingers busy.

Square,RPG,Square,"An enhanced port of the classic NES roleplaying game. Inspired by the success of Enix's Dragon Quest game, Square decided to release a similarly styled role-playing game with a different theme for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The title, Final Fantasy, debuted on Japan's Famicom in 1987 to critical and fiscal success. Final Fantasy's storyline, which dealt in mythological archetypes and confusing time loops, was deeper and more engaging than the one that powered the original Dragon Quest. Square's RPG also established left-against-right turn-based battle and magic systems that have been copied by competitors ever since. The game was a phenomenal success and has spawned a series that, initially exclusive to Nintendo consoles, later branched out to Sony's machines and non-interactive formats.

In Final Fantasy, the tale begins when four young warriors, each possessing a Crystal, are summoned to bring the world back to a harmonious elemental balance.

Crave Entertainment,Puzzle,SEGA,"The famous falling blocks are back! The world's most popular puzzle game returns with a few new twists in THE NEXT TETRIS: On-Line Edition. The action is relatively simple: on a playing field 10-blocks wide by 20-blocks high, different shaped pieces fall from the top of the screen and float down towards the bottom; your job is to turn each piece as it drops in order to form complete horizontal lines of blocks. As you fill in rows completely, they disappear but if your field fills up with pieces or if the time limit expires, you've lost the game. This concept is elementary, but highly addictive. NEXT TETRIS adds a few changes to the mix as well. ""Multimino"" pieces have been added, which contain different colored blocks within them. When these land the colors separate, and if they don't match the surrounding pieces, they fall down and fill in spaces below. These lines may fill up and disappear, creating a ""Cascade,"" where as many as five or six rows vanish in succession.

Capcom,Shooter,Takumi,"If you're looking for that rush of nostalgia that only 2D-scrolling shooters like GALAGA and GRADIUS can bring, then MARS MATRIX from Capcom may be the game for you. The year is 2309, and a Martian colony has revolted against Earth's government. You are a member of Earth's Defense Force and have been sent to the Red planet to quell the Martian rebellion. You'll have to pilot your Mosquito ship in a solo battle against waves of enemies in your frantic bid for survival. Fly as fast as you can, zipping in front of and behind backgrounds and buildings as the colorful but deadly projectiles rain down on your ever-changing position. Fly quickly and grab valuable power-ups that will upgrade your craft's standard weapon. You also have your handy pulse cannon and powerful Mosquito attack to assist you; the Mosquito attack sucks up all enemy bullets on-screen and spits them back out in an opponent-blasting explosion. The graphics in MARS MATRIX are bright, well-animated 2D sprites that look good (albeit in an old-style manner) and help to keep the pace blistering without any pesky slowdown.",Mars Matrix,http://www.ign.com/games/mars-matrix/dc-15621,http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/165/165621p1.html,38.99 USD,8.5,DC Arcade,"April 27, 2001","http://www.ign.com/games/cannon-spike-167939/dc-14734,http://www.ign.com/games/the-house-of-the-dead-2/dc-10956,http://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six/dc-11887,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/dc-12490,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/dc-9967",Great,8.3,Animated Violence,E for Everyone,Great
