With crime on the rise, the Marines have been called into the city to help maintain control. However, they are a few days away, and by the time they arrive, the gangs will have become full-blown crime syndicates. Now you must use five different vehicles, two airborne gun ships, the Havoc and Venom; a bipedal assault mech, the Raptor; an armored troop transport, the Rhino; and a Corsair space ship to take a bite out of crime.

Entering horses into races is easy, but winning takes extensive knowledge.

8.6,Great,"Rogue Spear is a shooter of a different cut. One without health packs and super-futuristic weapons. Death is as close as one shot away -- and since you're usually taking on a superior number of forces, the game stresses solid strategy and planning instead of running in with guns blazing. While your anti-terrorist organization will see action on three continents, most of Rogue Spear takes place in parts of Russia and the former Soviet states. Those familiar with Rainbow Six will be able to jump right into Rogue Spear without having to even crack open the manual. The controls are basically the same as in the original, with a few keys remapped to give it the playability of a more standard shooter. Like Rainbow Six, when you start a mission, you can either opt to go with the pre-determined routes, weapon loadouts, and squad assignments or choose your own.

Yu Suzuki has said he is determined to make the series look and play just like real fighting by the fifth installment, and the third game brought him amazingly close to his goal.

Gone are the floating arenas seen in most other 3-D fighters -- instead, we can intricately detailed environments which go well beyond the flat plane, introducing gradual vertical shifts which may give an opponent the advantage in battle. For the first time ever, positioning really makes a difference in the fight.

New to the series is the evade button, though the setup remains as simple as ever. Don't underestimate the simple control scheme though, since Virtua Fighter 3: Team Battle is easily the deepest fighter around.

7.7,Good,"Return to the court with this installment of EA Sports' spectacular basketball game for the N64. As always, NBA LIVE features the entire roster of NBA teams and players, awesome graphics, and lots of options. This version offers higher artificial intelligence, smoother player animations, and the most competitive action to date. LIVE 2000 has two modes: Arcade and Simulation. Arcade lets you pull out huge dunks and monster moves that would put the real pros to shame, while Simulation is a realistic take on NBA-style five-on-five basketball. You can also choose to go one-on-one on a street court at night or during the day. Reggie Theus and the Vancouver Grizzlies' Don Poier drop by to add commentary, and television-style camera shots abound making the affair very much like a fully televised NBA contest. Another great feature is the outstanding player creation option, which lets you build your own NBA athlete by assigning him more attributes than Jordan has rings. Speaking of which: guess whose likeness made it into the game? You got it.
