After two years of roundball domination on Dreamcast, Sega Sports unleashes its award-winning NBA franchise on the next-generation basketball court with NBA 2K2. Building upon a foundation of vibrant graphics and crisp, detailed player animation, NBA 2K2 talks the talk and walks the walk! High pick and roll? We got it! Killer crossover? It's in there! The big man's game? You betcha! On offense, use the versatile low post game to drop step around your defender and explode past him for a posterizing dunk, back him down into the key and pull up for a sweet hook, or lull him to sleep and pass to the open man. Tight AI defenders take away the baseline, deftly rotate to the open man, and establish rebounding position in the paint. Sharper skills and smarter D elevate your game to a higher level and make NBA 2K2 the one to beat.

Sierra,"Real-Time, Strategy",Mad Doc Software,"Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest includes three new single-player campaigns set in ancient Rome, the Pacific Theater of World War II, and Asia in the 24th century. In addition, each of the 21 pre-designed civilizations in the game gains a unique special power, building, or unit. Examples include: the Kingdom of Italy's Metallurgy power, which allows them to pay building costs with gold or iron interchangeably; Great Britain's S.A.S. unit will be able to plant demolitions and swim across water; and the United States' market building will allow that civilization to trade abundant resources for scarce ones. 
From Prehistory to the Space Age of the 24th Century, Empire Earth serves up gaming on an epic scale. Empire Earth and Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest cover over 500,000 years of human history, from the discovery of fire to the laser battles of the future. Each player takes control of a fledgling civilization and strives to forge the greatest of all empires.",Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest,http://www.ign.com/games/empire-earth-the-art-of-conquest/pc-481964,http://pc.ign.com/articles/372/372262p1.html,29.99 USD,7.8,PC,"Sep 24, 2002","http://www.ign.com/games/halo-wars-2/pc-20041132,http://www.ign.com/games/starcraft-remastered/pc-20066763,http://www.ign.com/games/rome-total-war-2/pc-136961,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/pc-20019837,http://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda/pc-20034220,http://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine/pc-20035505",Great,8.2,"Blood, Violence",T for Teen,Good
