THQ,"Third-Person, Shooter",Volition,"Red Faction: Guerrilla is a 3rd person, open-world action shooter set on Mars, 50 years after the events of the original Red Faction. Players take the role of an insurgent fighter with the newly re-established Red Faction movement as they battle for liberation from the oppressive Earth Defense Force.

Many adventurers delved into these labyrinths dreaming of riches, and those fortunate enough to return did so with amazing stories and unimaginable treasures.

The trash can will quickly reach full capacity unless the trash is broken down or dealt with by strategically using various elements given throughout each stage.  Items will continue to be dropped until the player successfully compacts a certain number of items or ends up with an overflowing trash can.  Each level will also feature a giant Boss item that players need to destroy in a certain amount of time to avoid getting  penalized. At the end of each stage, each player will be rated by how ""eco-friendly"" or ""ego-friendly"" each stage was completed.  The more ""eco-friendly,"" the higher the rating.  Ratings help in unlocking various levels and modes. Spread across three different game modes, Trash Panic offers fun gaming for everyone.",Trash Panic,http://www.ign.com/games/trash-panic/ps3-14288461,http://ps3.ign.com/articles/994/994425p1.html,4.99 USD,7.0,PS3,"June 4, 2009","http://www.ign.com/games/the-unfinished-swan/ps3-133433,http://www.ign.com/games/valiant-hearts-the-great-war/ps3-20005421,http://www.ign.com/games/never-alone/ps3-20040443,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/ps3-20006859,http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-online-mgs5/ps3-20028682,http://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-dragonborn/ps3-146419",Okay,6.5,"Mild Cartoon Violence, Mild Language",E for Everyone,Good

The game play is entirely new to the series, leaving the single-axis controls of BIT.TRIP BEAT behind in favor of the ability to control two axes.

Electronic Arts,Action,EA Bright Light,"In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information.  Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas.  And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane's chocolates! And then there's Hermione, simmering with jealously but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.

In the game, players will return to Hogwarts to help Harry survive a fraught sixth year. They will also have a chance to engage in exciting wizard duels, mix and brew magical ingredients in Potions class and take to the air to lead the Gryffindor Quidditch team to victory.

Electronic Arts,Action,EA Bright Light,"In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information.  Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas.  And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane's chocolates! And then there's Hermione, simmering with jealously but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.

In the game, players will return to Hogwarts to help Harry survive a fraught sixth year.

Electronic Arts,Action,EA Bright Light,"In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information.  Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas.  And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane's chocolates! And then there's Hermione, simmering with jealously but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.

In the game, players will return to Hogwarts to help Harry survive a fraught sixth year. They will also have a chance to engage in exciting wizard duels, mix and brew magical ingredients in Potions class and take to the air to lead the Gryffindor Quidditch team to victory.

Microsoft Game Studios,Shooter,Chair Entertainment,"Shadow Complex is set in the compelling universe of Empire, Orson Scott Card's best-selling novel outside of the famed Ender's Game series. The game provides a fresh twist on classic side-scroller action by delivering an original single-player adventure that unfolds across a range of non-linear levels. Gameplay centers around exploration and fast-paced combat as players gather power-ups to overcome obstacles, thwart enemies, and delve into a mysterious and challenging world.

Shadow Complex propels lost hiker Jason Fleming into the hollows of government conspiracy, dark politics and military upheaval. When Jason and his girlfriend, Claire, accidentally stumble upon a rogue paramilitary group called the Restoration, it soon becomes clear that the faction's intent is to set in motion a chain of events that will cause America to collapse into a civil war. Assumed to be a government agent, the Restoration captures Claire, and while this initially fuels Jason's motivation to find justice, he soon discovers the magnitude of what the sinister offshoot has planned.

METROID PRIME -- Samus Aran, a bounty hunter by trade, chases down the evil Space Pirates in the first game of the series. Their intention is to use a genetic mutagen called Phazon to create a super army and take over the universe. While the installments in the series before have never been home to deeply involving storylines, Metroid Prime breaks the shell to offer up one of the most intriguing and read-worthy sagas yet.

METROID PRIME 2: ECHOES -- Travel to a planet torn into light and darkness. Hunted by a mysterious entity and a warring race called the Ing, Samus Aran must explore the light and dark worlds of this doomed planet to discover secrets and augment her suit's weapons and abilities. And now, for the first time in the history of the celebrated Metroid franchise, up to four players can battle each other as they search for weapons, grapple across ceilings, and turn into Morph Balls to make their escapes.

METROID PRIME 3: CORRUPTION -- The Galactic Federation's Base Sector Zero is under attack by Space Pirates. Samus must boot up the generator to restore the defense systems. But at the end of her path, someone awful is waiting for her. The war initiated by Dark Samus and the Space Pirates rages across many planets as they attempt to corrupt each with Phazon seeds.

Capcom,Adventure,Bionic Games,"In Spyborgs, players take on the role of a diverse team of five bionic superspies in a fight to save the world from a group of dastardly villains. Players jump between the identities of a team of five bionic superspies to combat a rogue squad of wacky, dysfunctional super villains. Each character has unique powers to match their super-spy skills, such as heavy firepower, martial arts, bladed weaponry, acrobatic skateboarding skills or pure robotic destruction.  This cast of characters may make a misfit group individually, but by utilizing them as a team, the Spyborgs will have the power to save the world -- if they don't blow themselves up first!

Engaging players in team-based challenges designed to utilize 2-player co-op play, Spyborgs takes the theme of ""team"" to a whole new level.  In Single-player mode the ""team' theme continues as players jump from one member of the superspies' team to the next, rapidly tackling different challenges designed around each character's unique abilities. The game promises fast, addictive gameplay, unique controls offered by the Wii Remote as well as a storyline that refuses to take itself too seriously for a dynamic and fresh gaming experience.",Spyborgs,http://www.ign.com/games/spyborgs/wii-14251204,http://wii.ign.com/articles/102/1027385p1.html,39.99 USD,7.5,Wii,"September 22, 2009","http://www.ign.com/games/fatal-frame-ii-crimson-butterfly/wii-87940,http://www.ign.com/games/okami/wii-884970,http://www.ign.com/games/back-to-the-future-the-game/wii-116482,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/wii-865246,http://www.ign.com/games/the-last-story/wii-59789,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword/wii-872155",Good,7.5,"Crude Humor, Fantasy Violence, Mild Language",T for Teen,Good

Nintendo,Puzzle,FYTO (From Yellow to Orange),"Experience a unique combination of strategy and skill as you maintain a level playing field in the physics-based action puzzler You, Me, and the Cubes. The action centers around Fallos, mysterious creatures that resemble humans and have an ability to balance on a playing field of 3-D cubes.

First, create a pair of Fallos inside your Wii Remote controller by shaking it up and down. Next, determine suitable places for the Fallos to land, then fling them to the selected cube with a swinging motion. After that, the Fallos are on their own. If your placement is sound, the Fallos will remain stable and you'll clear the stage after tossing a required number onto the cubes.

In Final Fantasy, the tale begins when four young warriors, each possessing a Crystal, are summoned to bring the world back to a harmonious elemental balance.

Inspired by the success of Enix's Dragon Quest game, Square decided to release a similarly styled role-playing game with a different theme for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Final Fantasy's storyline, which dealt in mythological archetypes and confusing time loops, was deeper and more engaging than the one that powered the original Dragon Quest.

With temperatures plummeting, sudden avalanches, broken ice bridges, and three different racing altitudes, this is possibly the most inhospitable environment the MotorStormers have ever had to deal with. With grip at a premium, and in addition to the six existing classes from the original MotorStorm, two new vehicles have been introduced to combat the ice, the cold and the snow - the Snowcat and the Snow Machine. One has the power and size to blast through packed snow, whilst the other has the grip and pace to combat most of what the sub-zero conditions can throw at it.

A further new introduction to the MotorStorm festival is personalisation of your vehicle class. Each vehicle in the game has a selection of different parts - for example wheels, exhausts, spoilers - liveries and stickers to choose from. Players can also create their own liveries from a set of base patterns and decals.

Sony Computer Entertainment,Racing,"Virtuos Games, BigBig Studios","MotorStorm Arctic Edge sees the music, the festival and the brutal off-road racing arrive in the breathtaking yet lethal and unpredictable setting of Alaska. With temperatures plummeting, sudden avalanches, broken ice bridges, and three different racing altitudes, this is possibly the most inhospitable environment the MotorStormers have ever had to deal with. With grip at a premium, and in addition to the six existing classes from the original MotorStorm, two new vehicles have been introduced to combat the ice, the cold and the snow - the Snowcat and the Snow Machine. One has the power and size to blast through packed snow, whilst the other has the grip and pace to combat most of what the sub-zero conditions can throw at it.

A further new introduction to the MotorStorm festival is personalisation of your vehicle class. Each vehicle in the game has a selection of different parts - for example wheels, exhausts, spoilers - liveries and stickers to choose from. Players can also create their own liveries from a set of base patterns and decals.

Electronic Arts,RPG,BioWare,"Dragon Age: Origins is the spiritual successor to BioWare's critically acclaimed Baldur's Gate, featuring deep character customization and role-playing, morally challenging decisions, tactical party-based combat, and a wealth of gritty, mature sub-plots. It is a dark, heroic fantasy game that combines original storytelling techniques with classic role-playing challenges.

In Dragon Age, your choices change the world and affect the people around you. Certain situations, storylines, and conversation options will change drastically depending on your origin and your motivations. You choose your origin, and from that starting point, your story begins. You play through your character's early days, defining his or her background and motivation and begin to learn more about the world of Ferelden from your own distinct perspective. Your choice of origin defines how you will view the world and how it views you. Choose a sneaky, disrespected commoner and you will play a story that focuses around subtle skills and careful wordplay. Choose a noble origin and the world will be much more positive and helpful, but those jealous of your status will not be afraid to take what you have, violently if necessary.",Dragon Age: Origins,http://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-origins/pc-682217,http://pc.ign.com/articles/104/1041792p1.html,49.99 USD,9.0,PC Mac Xbox 360 PS3,"November 3, 2009","http://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda/pc-20034220,http://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine/pc-20035505,http://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3/pc-134497,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/pc-20019837,http://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda/pc-20034220,http://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine/pc-20035505",Amazing,9.1,"Blood, Intense Violence, Language, Partial Nudity, Sexual Content",M for Mature,Amazing

Star Trek: D-A-C allows fans to directly control a variety of ships and pitch battles between Starfleet and the Romulan Empire. Up to 12 players can compete in thrilling team combat. There are three game play modes: single player, online multiplayer and online co-op. For each mode, there are four different game types -- Team Assault, DeathMatch, Conquest, and the all-new Survival mode, pitting players against increasingly overwhelming waves of enemies in order to set the record for survival time. With the upgraded PC edition, players can now choose from five ship types for each faction - the all-new Missile Corvette, all-new Support Frigate, Bomber, Fighter and Flagship -- with each ship offering unique capabilities for players to master and manipulate as they fight for victory. The Missile Corvette, a heavy artillery ship features a longer range than any other ship in the game, but vulnerable to close range attacks due to a low rate of fire and slower flight speed. The Support Frigate allows players to heal friendly ships and easily target escape pods. The nimble Bomber speeds in and out of battles, dropping bombs in its wake. The Fighter attacks ships head-on, blasting missiles and dodging attacks. The durable Flagship allows players to target enemies with a reticule and inflict damage on incoming ships with its shields.

Star Trek: D-A-C allows fans to directly control a variety of ships and pitch battles between Starfleet and the Romulan Empire. Up to 12 players can compete in thrilling team combat. There are three game play modes: single player, online multiplayer and online co-op. For each mode, there are four different game types -- Team Assault, DeathMatch, Conquest, and the all-new Survival mode, pitting players against increasingly overwhelming waves of enemies in order to set the record for survival time. With the upgraded PlayStation 3 edition, players can now choose from five ship types for each faction - the all-new Missile Corvette, all-new Support Frigate, Bomber, Fighter and Flagship -- with each ship offering unique capabilities for players to master and manipulate as they fight for victory. The Missile Corvette, a heavy artillery ship features a longer range than any other ship in the game, but vulnerable to close range attacks due to a low rate of fire and slower flight speed. The Support Frigate allows players to heal friendly ships and easily target escape pods. The nimble Bomber speeds in and out of battles, dropping bombs in its wake.

The time is yesterday and the Cold War is in full swing. Through means devious and dubious you have seized power in the Caribbean island country of Tropico, where you now rule as the all-powerful ""El Presidente"". You decide whether you want to use your army to secure your power base in the best traditions of corrupt, unscrupulous tyrants everywhere or lead your people to prosperity in your role as generous elder statesman.

No matter whether you turn Tropico into a vacation paradise, a police state or a modern industrial nation -- you will always have to defend your actions before your people!

Press Play,Platformer,Press Play,"Like most kids Max loves to draw. One day he gets a mysterious marker in the mail. There is no letter attached â only the plain orange marker. Max decides to test it right away, sits down and starts drawing. He draws a monster but as soon as he finishes the lines on the paper start moving and to Max's great surprise the monster jumps off the paper and suddenly stands in all its glory in the middle of Max' room. A couple of Max' drawings lying around on the floor and without warning, the monster jumps right into one of them. Stunned by surprise Max now sees how the Monster starts messing around with his drawings, making them all weird painting moustaches on everything and messing things up. Max realizes that he has to follow the monster to set everything right. So he draws himself on the same drawing that the monster is in and immediately finds himself inside the drawing. The game begins.

Max & the Magic Marker is a physics based 2D platform game, in which the player controls the boy Max and his Magic Marker. While Max enables good old platforming fun, the marker proÂ­vides the game's signature feature: the ability for the player to draw directly inside the game world where everything drawn becomes physical objects.

Electronic Arts,Action,"A2M (Artificial Mind and Movement), Visceral Games","In Dante's Inferno, players  assume the role of Dante as he travels on an epic descent through Dante Alighieri's nine circles of Hell â limbo, lust, gluttony, greed, anger, heresy, violence, fraud and treachery. Players assume the role of Dante, who descends into Hell after returning home to find his beloved Beatrice murdered, with Lucifer seducing her soul into the underworld. His mission is to save Beatrice, but he soon realizes he is also in Hell to face his own demons and ultimately to redeem himself.

To take down the demons of Hell, Dante is outfitted with two primary weapons: the Scythe he takes from Death and the Holy Cross given to him by Beatrice, which has spiritual powers that will help Dante collect souls and spells from the creatures he defeats on his journey.

Working as a team, players can plan coordinated assaults to conquer massive armed fortresses and colossal beasts.

While immense castles, towers and ships serve as the settings for these legendary quests, the lighting-fast action will go where it has never gone before- the skies above. Gifted with new supernatural abilities characters can streak across the skies and battle enemies at high-altitude. With both single-player and multi-player quests, new ""air"" fighting techniques, radical character customization, new challenges to conquer, and downloadable content, Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce will forever change the way gamers experience the Dynasty Warriors universe.",Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce,http://www.ign.com/games/dynasty-warriors-strikeforce/ps3-22756,http://ps3.ign.com/articles/107/1078585p1.html,49.99 USD,8.0,PS3 PSP Xbox 360,"February 16, 2010","http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/ps3-20006859,http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-online-mgs5/ps3-20028682,http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-5/ps3-149839,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/ps3-20006859,http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-online-mgs5/ps3-20028682,http://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-dragonborn/ps3-146419",Good,7.4,Violence,T for Teen,Great

You do this by constructing towers along the path to attack oncoming Vectoids. Success is not based solely on the types of tower you select, but where you place them and what upgrade and bonus options you take.

At your disposal are eleven flavors of towers, each of which can be upgraded to level 10 (increasing the tower's damage and range). The Green Lasers, for example, lock onto one Vectoid and deal ongoing damage. The Red Spammer fires heat-seeking rockets at random targets in range. Blue Ray towers drain power and cause Vectoids to slow down. The in-game guide lists each tower in detail. Every few waves you'll also be rewarded with a Yellow Energy Cell, which you can use to purchase one of three Boosts. Damage and Range Booster towers can be placed on a grid to increase the stats of other towers around it.

Using wits and a trusty rocket pack, players must steer clear and overcome a hostile wolf army looming to take the lives of the Zephyrus people.

A 2.5D action adventure title, Rocket Knight brings expansive new worlds, each with massive platform levels and a rocket flying level. As players navigate through the challenges, their rocket pack can be used to ricochet off walls, launch Sparkster through obstacles and enemies in his way, and rocket drill through weak walls to create new passageways. Along with burst projectiles that shoot from Sparkster's sword to attack distant foes, a burst vortex can also be created from players' rocket pack to repel enemy bombs back at them. If all else fails, players can use Sparkster's prehensile tail to hang from and slide down rails in order to avoid danger.

Neko Entertainment,Platformer,Alien After All,"DodoGo! puts the lives of the extinct Dodo species in the hands of the player, with an adventure that will bring DSi users an explosive mix of action and strategy. The story for DodoGo! takes place back in the Cretaceous period, after a terrible tidal wave has swept away the home island for the Dodo species, stranding and scattering its eggs across an isolated piece of rock in the middle of the ocean. The devastating wave has also brought a hungry and sneaky predator to the island looking for tasty eggs to snack upon.

Lost and alone, the Dodo eggs will need a big helping hand, or rather a helping stylus, to get out of this mess and back to their nests. Armed with just a toolbox and their own ingenuity, players must guide the fragile Dodo eggs across nearly 100 levels of inhospitable environments while avoiding obstacles, pitfalls and threatening predators. Players cannot control the eggs themselves, but through manipulating the environment by digging, backfilling, sawing, scraping and cutting, players will work to succeed at returning the Dodo eggs back to their nests.",DodoGo!,http://www.ign.com/games/dodogo/dsi-1503,http://ds.ign.com/articles/108/1087389p1.html,8 USD,9.0,DSi,"April 26, 2010","http://www.ign.com/games/shantae-riskys-revenge/dsi-32321,http://www.ign.com/games/rayman/dsi-54668,http://www.ign.com/games/earthworm-jim-hd/dsi-65748,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-four-swords-anniversary-edition/dsi-110780,http://www.ign.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/dsi-103167,http://www.ign.com/games/art-style-aquia/dsi-14295129",Great,8.6,"Comic Mischief, Mild Cartoon Violence",E for Everyone,Amazing

The era is the 1970s. Big Boss has stations his ""Soldiers without Borders"" in Columbia, South America, where he was approached by a visitor from Costa Rica, ""a Nation without a Military.) In the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis, as Latin America became a key to maintaining the power balance between East and West, Costa Rica has miraculously managed to maintain its peace and neutrality. However, in various regions of the country, a mysterious armed force seemed to be engaging in suspicious activities.

Nintendo,Puzzle,Nintendo,"Control a circular creature-like organism known as a rotozoan and nimbly make your way through level after level of primordial ooze. Comprised of only three distinct parts (colored sides, tentacles and life force), the focus of your rotozoan life is simple: grow your tentacles. After playing a few levels and learning the basics of your microscopic world, you begin to unlock additional modes of play and the ability to choose the number of tentacles on your rotozoan.

Each mode has its own specific purpose: reach a particular length with your tentacles or grow them to the greatest length possible. In either mode, growing your tentacles means absorbing enemies known as goobugs by touching them. There's just one catch: Successfully absorbing a goobug depends on matching its color to your tentacle. Also, longer tentacles can more easily come in contact with incorrectly colored goobugs (causing damage to the tentacle and decreasing your life force), and the goobugs themselves multiply and begin adapting to your movement. Luckily, objects such as the restorative heart item and special attack-enabling cyclone item can be found floating in the ooze to help your rotozoan survive.

Konami,Action,Kojima Productions [2005-2015],"Stories tell of a legendary soldier who, with Metal Gear in his command, had once waged war against the world. His name was Naked Snake, a.k.a. Big Boss. Now, in response to a world hungry for answers, the truth behind this legend will finally be told.

The era is the 1970s. Big Boss has stations his ""Soldiers without Borders"" in Columbia, South America, where he was approached by a visitor from Costa Rica, ""a Nation without a Military.) In the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis, as Latin America became a key to maintaining the power balance between East and West, Costa Rica has miraculously managed to maintain its peace and neutrality. However, in various regions of the country, a mysterious armed force seemed to be engaging in suspicious activities. Now, to preserve peace in this nation without a military, the ""Soldiers without Borders"" move into action. In time, they would come to be known as the founders of ""Outer Heaven""...

Receiving no response, Ivy sets off through a dreamy forest, meeting many birds but none who share her resemblance. As she wanders, she stumbles upon a single glowing red feather and the first clue of her mother's whereabouts.

Presented in a beguiling storybook-like art style, Ivy the Kiwi? utilizes a unique control scheme to guide Ivy through her daunting journey. Ivy moves back and forth freely and independently of the player through timed 2-D side-view landscapes, and is guided by the use of vines created and controlled by the stylus as players aim to collect more orange feathers through the stages to boost their overall score. These stretchy vines herd Ivy forward, upstairs, over walls and dangerous spikes and other menacing obstacles. Multiple vines may be created and used in conjunction, and an existing vine can be pulled in a slingshot motion to propel flightless Ivy skyward or forward as a projectile to drill through barriers and enemies. Vines bend and flex with the motion of the stylus, but pulled too far and they snap!
