Pitball;http://www.ign.com/games/pitball/ps-308;Get ready for some fast sports action in PITBALL. The game takes place in arenas located on several planets scattered throughout a fictional galaxy. Each team's competitors fight for control of the energized Pitball, using attack moves both complex and simple. Once the Pitball is in possession, the player attempts to shoot it into the goal, which is a tiny hole at the top of the pit wall. With either fast but weak or slow yet strong teams to match your style of play, the variety of maneuvers and attacks results in some very exciting matches. The Season mode is great: using a combination of in-the-pit and behind-the-scenes maneuvering, it allows players to take a team and guide it from the bottom to the top. It's even possible to let the computer play the matches, which comes in handy when you'd prefer to rest your tired thumbs and focus on management.;http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid/ps-569,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/ps-11482,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2/ps-504,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673;Action;PS;5.0;Mediocre;6.2;Okay;Accolade;Accolade;E for Everyone;No Descriptors;Oct 29, 1996;49.99 USD;http://psx.ign.com/articles/150/150308p1.html

Vector graphics combined with a rotating control knob and easy to learn (but hard to master) gameplay made it a game that sucked the allowance out of your pocket one quarter at a time. Now that same game has come to the PlayStation with TEMPEST X3. In addition to the Classic Tempest, there are two other modes of play. In Tempest X, there are warp gates that will get you through certain levels, and an AI-controlled droid that helps you through some of the tougher spots. There is also Tempest Duel, which pits you against a friend and an unlimited supply of enemies. All of the action takes place to a new techno soundtrack that puts you in the right mood for the fast action that ensues .

Pitfall 3D;http://www.ign.com/games/pitfall-3d/ps-2101;In PITFALL 3D you're going to be taking Pitfall Harry (voiced by ARMY OF DARKNESS star Bruce Campbell) across levels built using the classic PITFALL formula. In other words, you'll see signature items like the swinging vines, nasty scorpions, gold bars, and plenty of jumping action. Everything is well placed in new environments, but some conventions, like the swinging action, are still pretty fresh among the new platformers. The story sees Harry entering another dimension that's being enslaved by an evil being called The Scourge, who's changing all the world's magical energy from good to bad.  PITFALL 3D is considered by many to be an excellent update of a classic game. Can you save the world from The Scourge?

While there are only three different types to choose from at the beginning, the number of choices will grow to 12 as more tanks are discovered throughout the game. Play takes place in either the Arcade or Quest modes. Arcade has the player fighting through 10 levels of driving and shooting action, where players can pick up new weapons like laser beams, plasma cannons, and missiles. Between each mission, there is the opportunity to change tanks. Quest mode plays the same way, except the player is not given the opportunity to switch vehicles and must drive the same tank through all of the levels.

Multi Racing Championship;http://www.ign.com/games/multi-racing-championship/n64-1916;Featuring up to 10 chooseable cars (many which open up later in the game), and three courses (plus mirror courses), Multi Racing Championship's biggest draw is the splendidly realistic feel of the cars themselves and the well designed courses on which they drive. The cars range from 4X4s, trucks, and off-road racers to slick street cars, Lamborghinis and the like. While initially it may seem like there is a deficit of courses, in fact, the multi-terrain courses contain mini-courses within each one. For instance, at least three times in each course, you will have the choice to take two different road directions -- either rough dirt track or snow-laden road, ot a slick but usually longer street course. Each car handles terrains differently, and some, like the trucks, obviously handle the off-roads better than others, but you can also modify your street car to handle dirst roads well, too.;http://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-64/n64-502,http://www.ign.com/games/diddy-kong-racing/n64-2146,http://www.ign.com/games/f-zero-x/n64-418,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933;Racing;N64;6.4;Okay;6.5;Okay;Ocean;Imagineer;E for Everyone;;September 5, 1997;5.95 USD;http://ign64.ign.com/articles/151/151916p1.html

NHL Breakaway '98;http://www.ign.com/games/nhl-breakaway-98/ps-1863;NHL BREAKAWAY '98 offers one of the most original features ever to appear in a hockey game: the Momentum-Based Checking System. Players can actually out-skate and out-muscle each other, depending on a player's size and speed. For example, some players may be smaller but are fast, while others may be slow but possess the strength and size to do all the dirty work. For instance, if a large, fast player such as Eric Lindros gets moving at a high rate of speed, the power behind his check is greater than what someone like Pierre Turgeon could produce. The game sports most of the usual play modes, and you can always take on a friend in the Versus mode.

Only consistently good and strategic play will win and advance your chosen cutie. There are 30 courses over five different happy-time worlds, all part of a giant Overworld. Racing is only part of the player's challenges, which include boss characters to defeat, stacks of silver coins to collect, multicolor balloons to snag, and yellow floating bananas to gobble up. After achieving success in a series of straight races, you then have to complete missions handed out by the pesky bosses. Each mission is harder, and after you manage to collect enough trophies for them you still have to race cute opponents in a sequential series of races to complete and win the Trophy Race. But there's help in the form of cool new weapons and vehicles, including a plane and a hovercraft. The game is beautifully rendered in all its bubble gum glory, and play is enhanced by the development of Realtime Dynamic Animation, which enables polygons to be more flexible and cover more area of Overworld.;http://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-64/n64-502,http://www.ign.com/games/f-zero-x/n64-418,http://www.ign.com/games/rush-2-extreme-racing-usa/n64-3852,http://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-64/n64-502,http://www.ign.com/games/star-fox-64/n64-419,http://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-rogue-squadron/n64-3964,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933;Racing;N64 NDS;8.4;Great;8.4;Great;Nintendo, Rare;Rare;E for Everyone;;Nov. 24, 1997;47.99 USD;http://ign64.ign.com/articles/152/152146p1.html

X-Men: Children of the Atom;http://www.ign.com/games/x-men-children-of-the-atom/ps-2331;X-MEN: Children of the Atom for the PlayStation is a port of the original arcade hit. The game features 2D animation, much like the art in the comic books that thrust the X-Men into the limelight. Many of the characters from the comics appear, from the popular to the obscure. The team's leader (Cyclops) shows up, as does the teleporter from another dimension named Spiral. Each character contains an extensive list of moves that start out simple but get progressively more difficult to perform. Careful timing and button combinations execute the moves, so plenty of practice is required. There is a Two-Player mode that lets you and a friend go head-to-head in a battle to the death. The backgrounds are all locations inspired from the cartoon and feature many of the well-known headquarters and bases. X-MEN: Children of the Atom fits the classic Capcom mold, yet has an identity all to itself.;http://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-alpha/ps-181,http://www.ign.com/games/digimon-world-2/ps-16355,http://www.ign.com/games/tekken-3/ps-2294,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673;Fighting;PS Arcade Saturn PC;3.5;Awful;6.8;Okay;Acclaim Entertainment;Probe, Capcom;E for Everyone;Animated Violence;March 3, 1996;19.77 USD;http://psx.ign.com/articles/152/152331p1.html

Monopoly [1998];http://www.ign.com/games/monopoly-1998/ps-2280;Monopoly for the PlayStation introduces a whole new generation to the classic board game. The object of the game is simple: bankrupt your opponents. The gameplay calls for you to roll the dice and circle the board, buy or trade properties, build houses and hotels, and charge rent when your opponents happen to land on them. The more expensive properties are more desirable, as the rent is proportionately higher. You must also avoid the long arm of the law and jail time, which causes you to lose a turn and potential profit. From the look of the board itself, to the wheelbarrow, race car, and dog used as pieces, to the color of the deeds, every detail is accounted for in the PlayStation version.

Monster Rancher;http://www.ign.com/games/monster-rancher/ps-2180;MONSTER RANCHER is the ultimate interactive experience. The game disc actually reads a small portion of any CD you put into your PlayStation, and uses that data to generate a monster. Some CDs will yield giant dragons, while others will give you smaller and less threatening beasts. After you create a monster, you then must train it in the ways of the monster pugilist. You control every aspect of the monster's training, from what it eats to what attributes it will be focus on improving. Monsters can be frozen for later use, or even combined with other monsters to form hybrid creatures that possess different abilities. The point of the game is to become the champion monster breeder, and there are rankings that give you an idea as to where you stand. Most of MONSTER RANCHER consists of point-and-click menus, with the exception of the fights themselves. There are two different options for fighting: you can let the computer control your beast or you can take manual control of it yourself.;http://www.ign.com/games/sim-theme-park/ps-13684,http://www.ign.com/games/monster-rancher-2/ps-11227,http://www.ign.com/games/harvest-moon-for-girls/ps-569712,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673;Simulation;PS;9.0;Amazing;8.3;Great;Tecmo;Tecmo;E for Everyone;Animated Violence;November 1997;26.99 USD;http://psx.ign.com/articles/152/152180p1.html

STREET FIGHTER for the PlayStation is a port of the arcade game, with a few new twists thrown in to keep it interesting. Namely the team-up aspect has changed, along with some of the moves.

Each character can execute special moves either with a partner or solo, resulting in some devastating attacks that will leave your opponent reeling. Although the game is in 2D with sprite-based graphics, the animation is smooth and the fighting almost resembles a moving comic. The special attacks all look spectacular, often filling the screen with colors and explosions that must be seen to be believed.

Things become more interesting when you have to select from three game modes. Pick between a Puzzle Game, where it's just you against the oncoming bubbles in a variety of clever patterns; Single-Player vs. Computer Player, where things get interesting because every time one of the increasingly odd cartoon opponents connects three or more bubbles, they pop and then appear on your screen; or Single-Player vs. Human Player, which is fun because while the computer plays with more precision, humans can be sneaky snakes who will send you over a batch of bubbles at the worst possible time.";http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-puzzle-challenge/n64-14801,http://www.ign.com/games/the-new-tetris/n64-10072,http://www.ign.com/games/sanrio-time-net-world/n64-10104,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933;Puzzle;N64 PS PC GB Saturn;8.0;Great;8.0;Great;Acclaim Entertainment;Probe;E for Everyone;;May 20, 1998;60.99 USD;http://ign64.ign.com/articles/153/153606p1.html

These synthoids have weapons fused to their bodies, and have only one purpose: they must destroy the synthoids of every other corporation to allow the their company to dominate.

Bio F.R.E.A.K.S.;http://www.ign.com/games/bio-freaks/n64-1924;Midway Entertainment's MORTAL KOMBAT popularized a style of arcade fighting that will probably last forever. Each time a new game comes out it, tries to do that vaunted series one better. For example, BIO F.R.E.A.K.S. features a cast of genetically mutated warriors who have their weapons surgically bound to their bodies. And there's enough hard-hitting action, carnage, and wanton destruction to keep even the most die-hard fans happy and coming back for more. The mega-corporations that own and operate the world in the future each have a BIO F.R.E.A.K.S. (Biological Flying Robotic Enhanced Armored Killing Synthoids) warrior protecting their territory. When a fighter wins a battle, his corporation takes over the other's territory which does NOT go over well back in the home office. The level of action escalates until you think you can't take it anymore but somehow you manage!

You create your challenger by choosing from various body shapes, heights, hairstyles, and faces. Once your gladiator is ready, you pick one of the game's cool characters to fight against. As you defeat each opponent in the ring, you'll be able to learn moves from them, eventually piecing together the best moves from each of the other fighters. Or you can use the Tag mode, where you form a three-person team; you can switch characters at any time, but anyone you drop is out for the game. Use all the fighting skills you can master (like punch, kick, block and evade), and add to your arsenal as you learn new moves.

Grand Prix Mode gives you three main cups composed of a few races each and there's a customizable cup that can last for up to eight races.

Moto Racer 2;http://www.ign.com/games/moto-racer-2/ps-3898;EA Sports is back with more high performance motorcycle racing in MOTO RACER 2. MOTO RACER 2 is essentially two motorcycle-racing games in one: you can race dirt or street bikes. The game has 32 tracks, some of which put you in the dirt with huge jumps that are good for trick jumping, while others are street courses that allow you to go full throttle and approach insanely high speeds. Also included is a 3D track editor, which allows you to increase or decrease elevation and make jumps and dangerous curves. If you're looking for multiplayer action, you can tear it up on the track against a friend in the Versus mode. Whether you like the challenge of dirt tracks or the wide-open expanses of street racing, MOTO RACER 2 has something for every motorcycle-racing fan.;http://www.ign.com/games/gran-turismo-1998/ps-2226,http://www.ign.com/games/crash-team-racing/ps-11595,http://www.ign.com/games/gran-turismo-2/ps-11426,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673;Racing;PS PC;8.7;Great;7.6;Good;Electronic Arts;Delphine;E for Everyone;No Descriptors;Fall 1998;34.99 USD;http://psx.ign.com/articles/153/153898p1.html
Circuit Breakers [1998];http://www.ign.com/games/circuit-breakers/ps-3943;CIRCUIT BREAKERS is new kind of racing game. Rather than racing on road courses, the tracks are more like roller coaster rides, with hairpin turns and drastic drops. And, like a roller coaster, there are no walls to keep you on the track. So, missing a turn will throw you into the abyss and cost you valuable time. Your ability to stay on course is tested in three play modes: World Series, Battle, and Time Trial. In World Series, try to beat seven opponents in 16 different races. Battle mode allows you to challenge three friends to a race. If you find the track too crowded, tackle the Time Trial mode and create new world records for each track. In all modes, the courses are littered with power ups including rocket boosters, shrinkers, and oil slicks that give the player a competitive edge. If you're tired of the same old racing games, give CIRCUIT BREAKERS a try.;http://www.ign.com/games/gran-turismo-1998/ps-2226,http://www.ign.com/games/crash-team-racing/ps-11595,http://www.ign.com/games/gran-turismo-2/ps-11426,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673;Racing;PS;8.0;Great;8.2;Great;Mindscape;Supersonic Software;E for Everyone;No Descriptors;Sep 2, 1998;48.99 USD;http://psx.ign.com/articles/153/153943p1.html

NFL Quarterback Club '99;http://www.ign.com/games/nfl-quarterback-club-99/n64-3796;Hard-hitting NFL simulation returns with this detailed football extravaganza from Iguana. The same folks that brought you TUROK and NFL QUARTERBACK CLUB '98 have returned to the gridiron, and have brought with them improved graphics, artificial intelligence, and play options. With full licenses from the NFL and its athletes, the game has all 31 NFL teams and 1500 players, plus perfect replication of logos and stadiums. As was the case with the '98 installment, you can play an individual game or a full season, but this version actually lets your players develop their skills over the course of the whole year. There's even a historical mode that allows you to tap into classic games of yesteryear, featuring teams that date back to 1967. The addition of six NFL Europe teams mixes things up as well. Iguana has tossed in some surprise stadiums (the Rose Bowl and Aloha Stadium among them), and included 250 new player animations. ESPN's Mike Patrick and Randy Cross are in the booth, and Brett Favre has returned to add his insight into the development of the gameplay. If you like the NFL and you like videogames, you just can't go wrong with NFL QUARTERBACK CLUB '99.;http://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/n64-14169,http://www.ign.com/games/mario-golf/n64-10628,http://www.ign.com/games/international-superstar-soccer-2000/n64-15240,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933;Sports;N64 PC;8.4;Great;7.5;Good;Acclaim Entertainment;Iguana Entertainment;E for Everyone;;Nov. 10, 1998;20.99 USD;http://ign64.ign.com/articles/153/153796p1.html

Future Cop: L.A.P.D.;http://www.ign.com/games/future-cop-lapd/pc-10635;Los Angeles is not always a nice place. In the 22nd century, criminals overrun the city, and Los Angeles is declared uninhabitable. You take control of a mech (that can transform into a hover bike) and try to clean up the streets. Use flamethrowers, plasma bursts, mini-shockwave mortars, and many other weapons as you battle through eight action packed levels by yourself or with a friend. For those who like a little more strategy, play the Precinct Assault mode, in which both players (you can challenge the machine or another human) start with bases and construct combat units. However, building the units cost points that are earned by destroying the enemy's equipment. The first to capture the opposition's base wins the game.

The rides themselves come in several flavors -- simple attractions like Ferris Wheels and Haunted Houses, and the more elaborate tracked rides, like log runs, miniature trains, monorails and of course roller coasters, that can be hand-designed to fit the local terrain or built from a default plan.;http://www.ign.com/games/civilization-beyond-earth/pc-20016115,http://www.ign.com/games/simcity/pc-128952,http://www.ign.com/games/civilization-beyond-earth-rising-tide/pc-20040683,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/pc-20019837,http://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda/pc-20034220,http://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine/pc-20035505;Economic, Simulation;PC Xbox;8.5;Great;8.6;Great;Hasbro Interactive;Microprose;E for Everyone;Mild Animated Violence;Mar 31, 1999;9.99 USD;http://pc.ign.com/articles/160/160759p1.html

Grand Theft Auto: London 1969;http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-london-1969/ps-11460;While expansion packs have been common on the PC, there has never been adequate technology for expansion disks on a console. GRAND THEFT AUTO: London 1969 changes that, as it's the first expansion pack to hit a console (you must own the original GRAND THEFT AUTO to play London 1969). As an expansion for the popular GRAND THEFT AUTO, London 1969 places you as a small time hood in swinging London. You must complete simple tasks as you move through the various levels of the British underworld. However, most of the tasks require pilfering automobiles. Keep in mind that you are in London, so the driver enters and exits on the right, and you'll want to stay on the left side of the road to avoid the coppers. All of the music and voices of the original game have been replaced with British rock and slang from the era to further thrust the player into 1969 London. Anyone who enjoyed the original GRAND THEFT AUTO should rush out and buy London 1969.;http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid/ps-569,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/ps-11482,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2/ps-504,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673;Action;PS PC;7.5;Good;7.0;Good;Rockstar  Games;Runecraft;M for Mature;Blood, Strong Language;April 1999;4.99 USD;http://psx.ign.com/articles/161/161460p1.html

Now the game returns, in color, portable, and expanded, on the Atari Lynx. As in the original Shanghai, you are presented with 144 mah-jongg tiles arranged in an organized, three-dimensional heap. By selecting matching pairs of ""free"" tiles (tiles not blocked by other tiles to the left or right), you whittle down the pile, and ultimately -- if your strategy is wise -- clear the heap.

Unlike most video games, the object isn't necessarily to kill the enemies. Sometimes an enemy is more like a puzzle that needs to be solved than a scary thing that wants to kill you.

In ""The Pirate Treasure Hunt,"" the babies travel underwater in search of items; ""Angelica's Temple of Gloom"" challenges players to find bits of Stu's broken Aztec statues before Angelica can; and ""Reptar Rally"" has the babies collecting sweets in Candy Island. Once you choose your baby from a list that includes Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, or Lil, you begin using a spinner (just like a board game spinner) to determine how many spaces you'll advance. There are lots of trick spaces that give you advantages or disadvantages, like the Spike the Dog spot (which allows you to ride the pet for five spaces), and a Dil spot (which makes Dil come out and shuffle the board). Don't get too worked up though, as each baby has an energy meter, and if it hits zero you'll have to take a nap.";http://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-64/n64-606,http://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-64/n64-607,http://www.ign.com/games/banjo-kazooie/n64-1922,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-437,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/n64-14248881,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/n64-1933;Platformer;N64;3.7;Awful;4.5;Bad;THQ;Realtime Associates;E for Everyone;Comic Mischief;June 29, 1999;58.99 USD;http://ign64.ign.com/articles/153/153876p1.html

There are two different modes, an Original Mode and a Simple Mode. The latter omits the game bonuses, name entry and ability to save high scores. Apart from regular settings, which let you enjoy the slot machine gameplay with normal rules, there is also the more advanced Pro Stage that gives players access to machine settings, adding quick stops, different double-ups and higher bets. Place your bet, hit a button and stop the reels at the right time to win more credits. There are eight lines, A through H. Numbers next to the letters increase (to a maximum of 8) as bets on lines are made. When pictures are lined up, the total below one of the bonus categories found on the right side of the screen decreases. Once the number becomes 0, a bonus is paid out.;http://www.ign.com/games/neo-mystery-bonus/ngpc-11054,http://www.ign.com/games/ward-of-lights/ngpc-741337,http://www.ign.com/games/del-sol-2/ngpc-550494,http://www.ign.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-pocket-adventure/ngpc-12670,http://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1/ngpc-11051,http://www.ign.com/games/samurai-shodown-2-pocket-fighting-series/ngpc-12019;Casino;NGPC;4.0;Bad;4.5;Bad;SNK [1978-2001];Dyna Corporation;E for Everyone;;May 1999;;http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/161/161061p1.html

Fighting Steel is set in real time and includes a 3D interface as well as map screens for plotting fleet course and for supplying orders. This interface, which is somewhat reminiscent of Jane's Fleet Command, makes the game a little more like a naval simulation than a full-fledged strategic war game, but this is a good blend of both worlds. The biggest downside to this style of 2D/3D interface is that it can be terribly confusing even to an experienced war gamer or simulation buff.

Bust-A-Move Pocket;http://www.ign.com/games/bust-a-move-deluxe/ngpc-12122;In this handheld adaptation of the classic puzzle game, there are four modes that all follow the same basic concept. Shoot colored bubbles from the bottom of the screen towards the top and try to align three of the same color to make them pop. Special bubble blocks, such as the Star Bubble or the Metal Bubble help or hinder you from achieving your goal. In Puzzle Mode, players try to clear the screen as quickly as possible, Vs-CPU is a battle against different computer opponents, Survivor is all about how long you can go without drowning in bubbles and Vs-Player has you go head-to-head against a human opponent via the link cable (you can also pick from three difficulty settings in this mode). Control of the bubble shooter is a cinch thanks to the NGP's nice thumb stick. B shoots, pushing left or right adjusts the degree, pushing up makes the shooter perpendicular and holding A while moving allows for more subtle adjustments.;http://www.ign.com/games/master-of-shogi/ngpc-11059,http://www.ign.com/games/puzzle-tsunagete-pon/ngpc-11804,http://www.ign.com/games/puyo-pop/ngpc-12970,http://www.ign.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-pocket-adventure/ngpc-12670,http://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1/ngpc-11051,http://www.ign.com/games/samurai-shodown-2-pocket-fighting-series/ngpc-12019;Puzzle;NGPC PSP;8.0;Great;8.2;Great;SNK [1978-2001];SNK [1978-2001];E for Everyone;;May 1999;;http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/162/162122p1.html

But these rides aren't as driver-friendly as today's cars, so it'll take some practice and patience before you start shredding up the track. So, if you're ready to feel the wind whipping through your hair at 200 mph, get your hands on MONACO GRAND PRIX and let the good times roll.;http://www.ign.com/games/crazy-taxi/dc-12006,http://www.ign.com/games/san-francisco-rush-2049/dc-13634,http://www.ign.com/games/yume-uma-ken-99-internet-142167/dc-13795,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/dc-12490,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/dc-9967;Racing;DC PS N64;7.6;Good;6.3;Okay;Ubisoft;Ubisoft;E for Everyone;;September 9, 1999;52.99 USD;http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/160/160996p1.html
NFL Blitz 2000;http://www.ign.com/games/nfl-blitz-2000/dc-9981;Midway returns to their hit football game with NFL BLITZ 2000 for the Dreamcast. The game is an upgrade from the arcade version of NFL BLITZ â99. There are numerous additions that make the game more exciting: you can play with up to four players: two on defense, two on offense. You can also write your own plays and use them later on. The game is like a normal football game, but with much more speed and far fewer rules. The result is a fun (if unrealistic) look at the NFL. Every team is faithfully represented, as are the players. This new version adds an On Fire mode, which allows players that have caught three consecutive passes to gain a special unlimited Turbo feature. This lets the player run much faster than normal and gives the player a distinct advantage. Anyone who likes to recreate games with their favorite teams but doesn't like the rules that slow down gameplay, NFL BLITZ 2000 is the perfect solution!;http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/dc-14676,http://www.ign.com/games/world-series-baseball-2k1/dc-13023,http://www.ign.com/games/power-stone/dc-10637,http://www.ign.com/games/crazy-taxi/dc-12006,http://www.ign.com/games/ready-2-rumble-boxing/dc-11165,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/dc-12490,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/dc-9967;Sports;DC PS N64 PC GBC;8.3;Great;7.8;Good;Midway  Games;Midway  Games;E for Everyone;Animated Violence, Mild Language;September 7, 1999;27.99 USD;http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/159/159981p1.html

You'll also have to look out for snakes and turtles, which can also ruin your day. Along the way, you can gobble up some flies and rescue other frogs to earn some extra points.

Tokyo Xtreme Racer;http://www.ign.com/games/tokyo-xtreme-racer/dc-11901;"You're cruising along a freeway in Tokyo when you see someone challenging you out of the corner of your eye. You flash your headlights, take on the dare, and you're off speeding down the highway in TOKYO XTREME RACER. Compete one-on-one in a series of sprints, which take place on two different Japanese highways. Your goal is simple: lead your opponent for a longer period of time than he is able to lead you.  Each driver has a meter that begins to count down when they are trailing. The farther the winning car is ahead, the faster the trailing car's meter runs down; the first meter to run out loses. Customize your car's stats and improve its performance if you're not winning like you think you should be. Beware of hitting dividers and walls, as they will drag your vehicle down costing you valuable speed. Earn money when you beat opponents and use it to upgrade your car, so you'll be ready to take on faster members of Tokyo's toughest racing gangs in TOKYO XTREME RACER.";http://www.ign.com/games/crazy-taxi/dc-12006,http://www.ign.com/games/san-francisco-rush-2049/dc-13634,http://www.ign.com/games/yume-uma-ken-99-internet-142167/dc-13795,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/dc-12490,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/dc-9967;Racing;DC;8.8;Great;7.9;Good;Crave Entertainment;Genki;E for Everyone;;September 9, 1999;28.99 USD;http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/161/161901p1.html

You start by creating a jockey, and then picking a horse; every horse has unique attributes as well as a unique temperament. Entering horses into races is easy, but winning takes extensive knowledge. You will need to know which horses run well on turf and which do better on dirt, as well as which animals are sprinters and which prefer long distance. As you win more races and buy more steeds, you will be able to breed the animals to create the perfect thoroughbred. If all of these options and decisions sound confusing, use the Practice mode to jump on a mount and ride around the track.

Disciples: Sacred Lands;http://www.ign.com/games/disciples-sacred-lands/pc-12718;Disciples is a turn-based fantasy strategy game that is clearly inspired by the Heroes Of Might & Magic series, and that is not a bad thing. Like Heroes, you have a town that you upgrade with new structures that give you access to new creatures. Like Heroes, you trot small groups around the map to claim resources and fight neutral monsters guarding treasures. Like Heroes, while all this is happening, some tough computer opponents (with quite good AI) are engaging in the same tasks as both sides prepare for the inevitable clash. So the basic gameplay is running a few groups around, fighting things, grabbing resources, upgrading your capital city, and then attempting to meet the victory conditions. This is all very much like Heroes Of Might and Magic. But let's talk about how Disciples veers off on a very satisfying different course.;http://www.ign.com/games/halo-wars-2/pc-20041132,http://www.ign.com/games/starcraft-remastered/pc-20066763,http://www.ign.com/games/rome-total-war-2/pc-136961,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/pc-20019837,http://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda/pc-20034220,http://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine/pc-20035505;Strategy;PC;8.5;Great;8.2;Great;GT Interactive;Strategy First;E for Everyone;Blood, Animated Violence;Oct 4, 1999;29.99 USD;http://pc.ign.com/articles/162/162718p1.html

One without health packs and super-futuristic weapons.

Those familiar with Rainbow Six will be able to jump right into Rogue Spear without having to even crack open the manual. The controls are basically the same as in the original, with a few keys remapped to give it the playability of a more standard shooter.

Chase H.Q. Secret Police;http://www.ign.com/games/chase-hq-secret-police/gbc-12315;The chase is on in CHASE HQ: Secret Police for the Game Boy Color. Loosely adapted from the arcade game of the same name, CHASE HQ is a unique mix of racing and action for one or two players. In the One-Player mode, you'll lead a handpicked team of undercover cops, each with unique talents. You'll be shown what kind of vehicle the suspect is driving, and then you'll hit the streets to find him. When you finally locate the perp, you'll switch to a behind-the-vehicle view as you try to shoot or bump the criminal off the road. Once you've managed to lower their life-bar far enough, they'll pull over and you'll make the arrest. There are 10 levels of single-player action, so you'll be plenty busy as you try to collar the criminals. You can also grab a friend to play Head-to-Head using a link cable, with one person playing the cop and the other playing the bad guy.

Virtua Fighter 3tb;http://www.ign.com/games/virtua-fighter-3/dc-9976;Virtua Fighter 3 was years ahead of its time and still the best looking arcade fighter available. Yu Suzuki has said he is determined to make the series look and play just like real fighting by the fifth installment, and the third game brought him amazingly close to his goal. A cast of twelve fighters, each sporting a unique real fighting art, battles in environments which reflect real world locations. Gone are the floating arenas seen in most other 3-D fighters -- instead, we can intricately detailed environments which go well beyond the flat plane, introducing gradual vertical shifts which may give an opponent the advantage in battle. For the first time ever, positioning really makes a difference in the fight.New to the series is the evade button, though the setup remains as simple as ever. Don't underestimate the simple control scheme though, since Virtua Fighter 3: Team Battle is easily the deepest fighter around. You simply cannot button mash your way through the ranks -- VF3:TB is all about skill. While the complex battle system may turn off some, there's no denying the game's place as one of if not the best fighting game around.

Each of the 99 levels starts with a unique arrangement of pipes and slotted gears. Balls of various colors roll through a pipe at the top of the screen, and they'll fall into the gear and pipe arrangement. The goal is to get balls of the same color to fill all of the slots of a gear. Once that happens, the balls disappear. But time is always a factor in doing this, so you've got to be efficient. As the game progresses, several complicating factors enter the mix: some pipes will only allow balls to travel one way, and other will only let balls of one color pass through. The biggest problem is that some levels require colors be removed in a particular order.

SEGA Rally 2: Sega Rally Championship;http://www.ign.com/games/sega-rally-2-sega-rally-championship/dc-9972;Sequel to SEGA's ground-breaking 3D rally racer. Available to the discerning home gamer are 17 fully 3D tracks, selectible as multiple routes through the game's six graphical themes. Each theme requires players to adapt to particular effects - you'll have to drive differently in the snow themed tracks when compared to the muddy tracks, for instance. The tracks themselves are filled with different surface types, and you'll find yourself racing across pavement, through dirt, and through the mud. The developers have also included various weather modifications, so you'll see the same track with and without rain, as well as nightime driving, where your car's headlights will light up and you'll have to use caution.;http://www.ign.com/games/crazy-taxi/dc-12006,http://www.ign.com/games/san-francisco-rush-2049/dc-13634,http://www.ign.com/games/yume-uma-ken-99-internet-142167/dc-13795,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/dc-12490,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/dc-9967;Racing;DC PC Arcade;9.0;Amazing;8.2;Great;SEGA;SEGA;E for Everyone;No Descriptors;November 24, 1999;49.99 USD;http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/159/159972p1.html
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six;http://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six/n64-10587;"Combining the best elements of action and strategy games, RAINBOW SIX is as tense as they come. Choose your character directly from the Tom Clancy thriller that inspired the game, then put your thinking cap on, because you're going to have to plan out this entire mission on your own. Venture into the dens of terrorists, diffuse bombs, and free hostages, as top-notch military strategy is of utmost importance. Details are the name of the game here you start with a map of the level, set your waypoints and operative strategies, select gear, and more. Once you've set all of these things up, your team will actually execute the orders you've registered whether you're with them or not; if you're storming into a building, your fellow Rainbows might be picking off snipers or setting a bomb. The graphics are smooth and consistent, the music is intense, and with 12 missions, the game lasts a long, long time. In the tradition of GOLDENEYE, the action takes place from a first-person perspective, and you can choose a Quick-Start option that skips over the strategizing and lets you get right into the fray.

As a member of the Office of Strategic Services department, you're called upon to do your duty and help the Allies win the war.

To accomplish these task gamers get to use 12 authentic period weapons including the Tommy gun, potato masher grenades, and the powerful bazooka.

If your team just doesn't work, play GM and execute a few trades, sign some free agents, release the dead-weight players, and make some good draft picks.

Babe and Friends;http://www.ign.com/games/babe-and-friends/gbc-12011;Puzzle fans that enjoyed the BABE movie series will find a lot to like here. BABE AND FRIENDS, a single-player puzzle game for Game Boy Color, has the little porcine hero guiding his herd through 40 levels that span such locations as the farm, the airport, and the city. In each level there is a checkered flag, to which Babe must take a herd. The sheep aren't very good at finding their own paths, so Babe has to walk them through every step of the way. Clear obstacles, set up roadblocks to make detours, and generally do what you have to in order to make a safe route for the sheep. Watch out for obstructions such as carts in the airport and rushing rivers on the farm. Detailed still-screens of all of Babe's friends appear between the levels to move the story along. A password save system is included if you need to take a break from the brain-bending action.

Glover;http://www.ign.com/games/glover/ps-3903;A wizard has been assigned to watch over the magic crystals in the kingdom. While performing an experiment, his gloves fall into a cauldron, and the resulting explosion scatters the crystals across the land. The substance in the cauldron makes the gloves come to life. The good news is that one of the gloves is good and wants to recover the crystals. The bad news is that the other glove is evil and wants the crystals for his menacing plans.

But it's more than just great gameplay; 40 WINKS also has a very intriguing story line. An evil magician named ""NiteKap"" has a terrible case of insomnia. No matter what he tries, he can't fall asleep--and the more tired he gets, the harder it is for him to nod off. That's why he decides to ruin everyone's sleep by turning mystical creatures called ""Winks"" into ""Hood-Winks,"" which are evil and nasty.

Catz;http://www.ign.com/games/catz/gbc-12930;Are you looking to adopt a pet but lack the time or space to take care of a real one? Then you may find CATZ to be of interest. Part of the small but popular virtual pet genre, CATZ lets you adopt a cat from one of three breeds: Siamese, Calico, or Persian. You can play with the pet first to decide if it's right for you. Once you've adopted the little gal or fella, it's up to you to take care of it: feed it, groom it, and play with it regularly if you want it to grow up to be a well-adjusted adult. If you mistreat your cat, your little pet will take off, never to return! Eventually, new breeds of cats and new special toys will become available for you, depending on how well you do. You can also trade toys and breeds of cats with your friends via the infrared link.;http://www.ign.com/games/harvest-moon-gbc-3/gbc-17428,http://www.ign.com/games/legend-of-the-river-king-gbc/gbc-12933,http://www.ign.com/games/kawaii-hamster-2/gbc-740681,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-silver-version/gbc-16709,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-gold-version/gbc-12865,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-crystal-version/gbc-15402;Simulation;GBC GBA;5.0;Mediocre;4.3;Bad;Mindscape;Mindscape;E for Everyone;No Descriptors;December 1999;33.99 USD;http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/162/162930p1.html

Q*bert;http://www.ign.com/games/qbert-886070/ps-11432;The much-loved orange hero returns to the spotlight in this faithful update on the coin-operated classic. In the PlayStation version, you'll find the original game, a new Adventure mode, and a fun two-player Head-to-Head version of the arcade game. As you might recall, the original Q*BERT challenges you to hop the little guy around a pyramid of cubes, changing their colors as he lands on them. The object is to transform the colors of each cube in order to advance to the next pyramid. Of course, it won't be easy, as you avoid enemies (like our hero's nemesis, Coily the snake), pick up special items, and try not to fall off. Other enemies will change the cubes' colors back, making your job even harder. In the new Adventure mode, Coily has kidnapped some of Q*bert's friends, and the orange fellow will have to hop on some cubes to free them. Unlike the original, there are differently shaped boards, secret levels, transports, and special cubes to spice things up. The Head-to-Head game is much like the arcade original, with two players trying to change the cubes to their own colors and attempting to snag as many bonus cubes as possible along the way. It's nothing but fun, as a classic makes its triumphant return.;http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid/ps-569,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/ps-11482,http://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2/ps-504,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/ps-494,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii/ps-3847,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/ps-13673;Action;PS PC DC Mac;6.9;Okay;6.8;Okay;Hasbro Interactive;Artech Studios;E for Everyone;Animated Violence;December 1999;14.97 USD;http://psx.ign.com/articles/161/161432p1.html

There are more than 1,500 riffs and 3,000 instrument sounds to choose from, and you can even write your own parts instead of using the pre-programmed melodies.

The next step is to create a music video for your masterpiece, and you'll have plenty of 3D clips at your disposal in so doing.
