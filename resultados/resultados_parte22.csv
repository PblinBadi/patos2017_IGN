Nnooo,Puzzle,Nnooo,"The idea for the game is to pump up the bubbles using the Wii remote to create bigger explosions. The concept is deceptively simple. Pop is a bubble shooting game with strong puzzle elements and four player drop-in, drop-out multiplayer. Once the game kicks off, a timer at the top of the screen counts down. As you pop bubbles, you get a small boost to your time, keeping you in the game. If you shoot the background, you get a time penalty. Three or four shots like that and the game ends, leaving you to lick your wounds. The strategy slowly becomes apparent - bigger bubbles give you more time, but smaller ones give you more points - which is key in multiplayer. Thus, being quick-thinking and accurate are the skills you need. The game's main mode is a progressive arcade mode where you and up to three other friends combo-pop your way through 16 gorgeous waves of bubbles, and other single- and multi-player modes are included as well.",Pop,http://www.ign.com/games/pop/wii-14212683,http://wii.ign.com/articles/873/873334p1.html,7 USD,6.0,Wii iPhone iPhone,"May 12, 2008","http://www.ign.com/games/boom-blox/wii-892269,http://www.ign.com/games/angry-birds/wii-82426,http://www.ign.com/games/world-of-goo/wii-14230233,http://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-wii/wii-949580,http://www.ign.com/games/boom-blox/wii-892269,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-jam/wii-56365,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/wii-865246,http://www.ign.com/games/the-last-story/wii-59789,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword/wii-872155",Okay,6.5,,E for Everyone,Okay

Up to four players link together, and the randomly-decided leader of the group begins by writing a command or list of instructions on the touch screen to send to every other player. Once written, the group leader then sets an amount of time allowed for the challenge, and then beams it out to each of the other DS units. From there, it's all about drawing or writing on the DS's touch screen, as each player attempts to win the votes at the end of the round. Once finished all pictures are sent to the group leader, they reveal them one at a time or all at once, and everyone slides three vote tokens onto any number of pictures (their own included).

Your bounce shield will send the fireball hurtling at your foes based on the angle of incident and speed of deflection, and by holding down the game button, you can ""catch"" the fireball to aim it where you want to attack and release it at super-speed. The game becomes heated the more you play, but the real fun is when other players take up arms in multiplayer play! Deflect the attacks as best you can as more and more fireballs appear and don't let any one of your three crafty opponents get the best of you -- some might even strike up an alliance with one castle to double up against their most hated rival, but don't forget that only one may stand at the end!

This next-gen Alone in the Dark is also built around a unique episodic game structure -- the story is split into a number of distinct 30-40 minute episodes, doled out one at a time as you play. Each time the player launches a saved game, the episode will begin with a video summary of the previous episode to quickly re-immerse the player in the story and removing the need to remember where they were or what they were doing. Every episode will close with a nail-biting cliff-hanger ending to rattle players' nerves, and if the player is leaving the game a video teaser of the next episode will play to leave them wanting more.",Alone in the Dark,http://www.ign.com/games/alone-in-the-dark/xbox-360-774387,http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/883/883633p1.html,59.99 USD,3.5,Xbox 360 PS3 Wii PC PS2,"June 23, 2008","http://www.ign.com/games/life-is-strange-episode-4/xbox-360-20031276,http://www.ign.com/games/the-walking-dead-the-game/xbox-360-100888,http://www.ign.com/games/life-is-strange-episode-5/xbox-360-20031282,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/xbox-360-20006860,http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-online-mgs5/xbox-360-20028684,http://www.ign.com/games/halo-4/xbox-360-110563",Okay,6.0,"Blood and Gore, Strong Language, Violence",M for Mature,Awful

Burning Fight is a side-scrolling hand-to-hand-combat action game.

Each character fights using a combination of punches, kicks and jumps, plus his own particular special move, activated by simultaneously pressing the jump and attack buttons. These lethal techniques have enormous destructive force, but they also consume a great deal of energy. For this reason, players must use their special moves with skillful timing. Luckily for the detectives, new weapons and additional health can be found by breaking things like phone booths and street signs along the way. A boss, who must be defeated in order to continue the mission, awaits players at the end of each stage.

Takara,Fighting,SNK [1978-2001],"A downloadable version of the 1992 NeoGeo game, provided through Nintendo's Virtual Console service.

Fatal Fury 2 is the second installment in the renowned fighting-game series. In addition to Terry, Andy and Joe, who appeared in the original game, another five distinctive fighters gather from around the world to compete for the championship title. Also newly added are stage-specific hazards and the ability to perform desperation attacks when a character's strength is low. These particularly deadly techniques create the chance for a come-from-behind victory achieved with a single strike.

Moreover, the innovative two-line battle, which proved popular in the previous version, also has been radically enhanced. Pressing the weak-attack and strong-attack buttons simultaneously enables players to move their fighters to another line themselves, or to launch an attack that pushes opponents back to another line. This game mechanic, unique to this title in the series, allows the player to take advantage of the depth of the screen and create even more exciting bouts.
