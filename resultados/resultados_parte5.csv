SEGA,Puzzle,Tremor Entertainment,"If you're looking for an alternative to SOLITAIRE on your PC, then SEGA SWIRL is the game for you. The object of the game is simple: clear the board of all the different colored swirls (which look eerily like the Dreamcast logo). As you remove a swirl or group of swirls, the remaining swirls fall down to fill the gap left by the removed swirls. In essence, SEGA SWIRL can be thought of as an inverse TETRIS. You get more points for removing chains of swirls, so strategy is an important element of the gameplay. As you progress, chains will become less frequent and planning and forethought become the real challenge. There are several different game modes available, like playing against the computer, against up to three friends, or just against the clock. You can also play through e-mail, which slows the gameplay down considerably but gives you many more possible opponents.",SEGA Swirl,http://www.ign.com/games/sega-swirl/dc-13481,http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/163/163481p1.html,,8.2,DC Palm PC,"January 12, 2000","http://www.ign.com/games/super-puzzle-fighter-ii-x-for-matching-service/dc-492483,http://www.ign.com/games/chu-chu-rocket/dc-14096,http://www.ign.com/games/bust-a-move-4/dc-14152,http://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate/dc-12490,http://www.ign.com/games/nba-2k1/dc-14602,http://www.ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes/dc-9967",Good,7.5,,E for Everyone,Great
