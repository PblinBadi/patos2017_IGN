Raindrops fall and splatter on your screen, shifting perspective as you tilt your device. Touch the screen and guide the path of the raindrops, stepping through the notes of an eerie melody as you go. It's a relaxing, intriguing experience that feels as if you're holding a living window in your hands.

The more you touch, however, the more strange the rain becomes: layered skies, visual anomalies and shifts in speed and color, even the occasional cataclysm if you're not careful. Before your eyes and beneath your fingers, the familiar becomes strange, and the strange, familiar.

Strange Rain has three play modes. In ""wordless"" mode, you can simply enjoy the sights and sounds of the falling rain. In ""whispers"" mode, touching the screen causes some raindrops to turn into words as they fall—words inspired by the qualities of rain.

In ""story"" mode, every touch triggers a thought as text on screen. These thoughts tell the story of a man in the midst of a family crisis who has wandered into the rain to collect his thoughts. His world, too, has gone from familiar to strange, even as his beliefs are following the opposite course. Your interaction helps determine when and how he decides to come in from the rain.
