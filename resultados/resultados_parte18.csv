Sierra,Platformer,Krome Studios,"That fire breathing purple dragon SPYRO is back in Sierra Entertainment and Krome Studios' THE LEGEND OF SPYRO: A NEW BEGINNING for the Game Boy Advance. This new game in the series serves as a prequel of sorts, examining Spyro's life as a young dragon, and focuses more on combat and less on the platforming aspects that were present in previous Spyro games. The game begins with Spyro hatching out of an egg and being raised by dragonflies. He has no idea that he's a dragon, but once Spyro discovers this, he will have access to many of his dragon talents, including fire breathing and flying. He will need all of these abilities to take down the evil black dragon Cinder, who is plotting to resurrect an evil force and take over the world. Spyro's breath attack can be modified with elemental powers, and each of these four elements has three different attacks that Spyro can access once he collects enough gems. Each attack has its own uses. In addition to elemental blasts, Spyro also has access to fury moves that will devastate enemies all over the screen. Some enemies are only vulnerable to specific elements, so players will have to watch carefully and determine which attack to use. With large levels, many attacks, and a great storyline, THE LEGEND OF SPYRO: A NEW BEGINNING is a great game that explores Spyro's past and turns him into the dragon hero everyone loves.",The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning,http://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-spyro-a-new-beginning/gba-801387,http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/756/756863p1.html,29.99 USD,4.5,GBA Cell NDS Xbox 360 Xbox GCN PS2,"October 12, 2006","http://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-bros-3/gba-497892,http://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-world/gba-16931,http://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-world-2-yoshis-island/gba-482090,http://www.ign.com/games/metroid-fusion/gba-16227,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-emerald-version/gba-692344,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-ruby-version/gba-17508",Bad,4.4,Animated Violence,E10+ for Everyone 10 and older,Bad

Stripped of godly power, the Master must somehow put an end to the Evil One's reign and rebuild his desolate realm.

Game play alternates between two modes: Action and Simulation. In Action mode, the Master must battle against impossible odds to pacify six lands. Pacifying a land unlocks Simulation mode.
