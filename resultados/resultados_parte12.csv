The Eye Toy, for players unfamiliar with it, is a camera that connects to the PS2 and projects a mirror image of the player on the screen.

The goal is to move your hand over the circle as the dot moves over it. Timing is everything, of course: getting the dot and circle lined up exactly scores you bonus points. As levels progress, the game throws in extra challenges. Dots with trails behind them make you shake your hand over the circle for a few extra seconds. The circles can also change into arrows for your hands to follow. A few times per round, the game will move into pose mode, asking players to strike the indicated pose to score points. In addition to the single-player game, EYE TOY: GROOVE includes a multiplayer mode for up to four people and a custom mode where players can create their own moves.

Eidos Interactive,"Third-Person, Action",Io Interactive,"Eidos Interactive's HITMAN: CONTRACTS for the Pc Games is the third game in the HITMAN series, which revolves around the assassin known only as 47. The game takes place as a series of flashbacks 47 sees as he lies dying. During these flashbacks, players experience a wide range of action and stealth missions as they shoot their way across the world. The flashback missions 47 sees during his injury-induced visions include some of the missions from the original game and some new missions, although the original missions have all been upgraded and expanded, so returning players won't feel like they're repeating previous games. Missions include eliminating a pair of brother assassins, disrupting a Russian arms deal, and escaping an asylum as he moves across the globe. Characters tend to speak in their native languages, as well, adding to the international flavor. 47 has many different abilities and weapons available. He can move stealthily, steal clothing to disguise himself, and use a number of poisons in addition to guns to take out his enemies. In many places, players have the option of accomplishing a mission using stealth or attacking enemies head-on, depending on their playing style. There are three difficulty modes, as well, so novice and experienced players can both enjoy the game.

Once the goods have been delivered, you must finish off the bad guys in New York. Now, you don't always have to confront these thugs face-on.

Nintendo,Action,Nintendo,"In 1987, Nintendo players were introduced to Link, a brave hero who had been summoned to the land of Hyrule to find the eight pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda from the evil Gannon. Players never imagined this magical quest would be the first of many for Link and Zelda, and now they can relive it all over again on the Game Boy Advance as part of Nintendo's Classic NES Series. Graphically, musically, and gameplay-wise, Nintendo has reproduced the classic LEGEND OF ZELDA on the Game Boy Advance, perfect for on-the-go gamers. The plot is fairly straight-forward: as Link, you must defeat a variety of enemies as you search for the hidden pieces of the Triforce. Once all eight are reassembled, you can enter Gannon's lair, defeat him, and save Zelda. Along the way, Link will pick up different items to help him in his quest, including a boomerang, bow and arrows, a raft, and some bombs. Once Gannon has been defeated, players get the option to start a new quest and play through ha remixed version of the game. For older gamers who have fond memories of slaying dragons with Link, here's your chance to turn back time. Fans of the more recent ZELDA games should take this opportunity to see where it all began.

NIS,"Turn-Based, Strategy",NIS,"PHANTOM BRAVE by Atlas USA is a quirky strategy RPG for the PS2 centered around Marona, a young girl who can see spirits. This isn't all it's cracked up to be, though; she's been exiled from her town for being possessed. So, with her dead, invisible guardian Ash by her side, she sets out to make some money as a mercenary and, as usual, gets swept up in a quest much bigger than she ever imagined. The battles in PHANTOM BRAVE involve you moving your army across the field to do battle. Turns are decided by stats, meaning some characters will get to attack more often. PHANTOM BRAVE throws out the conventional character recruitment system, however. Instead, Marona summons spirits from the netherworld to fight for her. But she can't just summon them anywhere; she has to channel their spirits into objects rocks, grass, etc each of which gives the summoned spirits different attributes and abilities. The battlefields in PHANTOM BRAVE aren't just backgrounds. Your characters can grab anything, even enemies, and throw them around. Certain objects on the battlefield offer stat-boasting protection or special abilities, too. If you think this game sounds odd, you're right, but that's the goal with PHANTOM BRAVE. The story and characters are humorous and, at times, even silly, but there's a deeper plot and even the silliest of characters has dimensions and personality.
