8.2	Great	At its peak, the Roman Empire encompassed most of Europe and North Africa. Praetorians focuses on military combat between three civilizians: Romans, Barbarians (Gauls, Germanics, Celts) and Egyptians. The only resource that is managed are troops that can be recruited and trained from captured villages. Through fighting, units also become more seasoned, gaining better armor and combat abilities. Deploying chiefs with units provides more formations and special abilities. The single-player story has three intertwined campaigns: one within the Roman Empire, one in Central and Northern Europe, and one in Egypt. Exciting missions include the siege of fortresses, which can be entered by destroying the gates or scaling the walls with ladders and assault towers.

7.8	Good	"Lionhead Studios and EA Games took players into a magical world with the hit real time strategy game Black & White. Now Mac gamers can experience all of the action from the original BLACK & WHITE plus the expansion pack Creature Isle in the Black & White Platinum Pack.

In Black & White, gamers create their own monster to serve as the primary commander of their forces. The interesting part of Black & White, and the aspect of the game referenced in the title, is that players can make their creature either good or bad. The world of Black & White is based on belief, and each action a player makes either adds white or black to their belief color. Gamers can either turn their creature to the white side by protecting citizens and helping villagers or to the dark side by destroying towns and terrorizing everyone. As belief builds, other characters in the game start treating the creature differently. The game begins with players in one city. They must direct their creatures to perform various miracles and other actions and, from time to time, overcome the challenges thrown at them by the other gods of the realm. The goal is to gain enough power to rule over the entire city.

In addition to the single player game, Black & White Platinum Pack also features LAN and internet play, offering gamers unlimited adventures in a land full of monsters and magic."

7.2	Good	Tale in the Desert is a massively multiplayer, online RPG set in Egypt that is not built on combat with monsters or humans. Instead, it focuses on negotiation and politics as players participate in or lead large projects. The Pharaoh accepts a challenge from a mysterious stranger that his people can pass seven tests of perfection in each of seven disciplines of man: Leadership, Thought, The Human Body, Worship, Architecture, Art and Music, and Conflict. Each player attempts to be perfect in one of the disciplines and the community will build magnificent monuments to proclaim the greatness of Egypt. As in other RPGs, your character has statistics, levels, skills, and inventory. An additional interesting twist is that by gathering enough signatures, the players can petition the programmers to change the rules of the game.	eGenesis	Persistent Online, RPG	8.9	Great	PC		eGenesis	RP for Rating Pending		http://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda/pc-20034220,http://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine/pc-20035505,http://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3/pc-134497,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/pc-20019837,http://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-andromeda/pc-20034220,http://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine/pc-20035505	February 15, 2003	http://pc.ign.com/articles/388/388867p1.html	A Tale in the Desert

Players will find a host of new gameplay features to help balance the odds. Exhilarating new maneuvers enable players to swing around enemies, target and destroy swarms of enemy fighters, tear down walls to use as shields or as a weapon, and even teleport out of danger. There are also more sub-weapons that support basic attacks and enhance strategic play during combat.

The game's setting expands greatly beyond that of the first ZOE: battles will be fought in canyons, cityscapes, enemy fortresses and even in the depths of space.

You can achieve dominance through economic power, military might, technological prowess, even political maneuverings. You'll be presented with decisions that have not only tactical but ethical ramifications, both of which will have an effect on the game. Stardock promises involved campaigns that will continue to develop even after many turns have passed.

6.4	Okay	Crazy Taxi is headed for the Gameboy Advance! For those who haven't played or seen it yet, Crazy Taxi puts you in the role of a psychotic driver obsessed with getting fares to their destinations in the least amount of time. The fares are REALLY impatient, so you've got to break every traffic law in the book. Jumps, massive traffic jams, and generally insane driving ensue. Your fares will increase their tip if you manage to weave through traffic without getting hit. If you don't get to the destination on time, they'll jump out of the cab and you don't get the money.

8.6	Great	This Angel-developed street racer deals out more than 28 street machines over three massive cities. Depending on the race, players can either follow an obvious course or find their own routes, using quick instincts and knowledge of the city's side streets, alleyways, shortcuts and ramps. Like the first in the series, the open design provides players with intelligent choices to make, instead of fixed rails in which to proceed. Career mode starts players off in a city and enables them to freely choose an opponent by flashing their lights, communicating the desire to drag. The game supports two-player split-screen racing and online play for up to eight.

In this case, you played the part of the maniac. The same development team returned with a sequel, this time cast in the form of a first-person shooter. Set in a fictional small southern Arizona mining town called Paradise, Postal 2 opens the doors even wider and renders a living, breathing world for the player. Players' interactions with the world determine how its citizens respond. Lots of bystanders and completely explorable environments attempt to give a sense of real world interaction.

Grom is a simplified RPG with real-time battles that are tightly woven into its intricate and non-linear plotline. The player commands a squad of soldiers whose actions are determined by the game's AI. Outcomes of the real-time battles are determined by statistics rather than reflexes.

But realizing that he needs a champion of his own to take down the Last Son of Krypton, Luthor hatches an insidious plan that involves busting malevolent cyborg Metallo out of Strykers Island Prison. It?s too bad, then, that Metallo?s first priority is to eradicate the man he blames for his gruesome transformation from a hired mercenary into hideous cyborg monster?Lex Luthor himself."

The greedy Sea Urchins have stolen all of Clu Clu Land's gold bars and buried them in a series of mazes. As Bubbles, a brave bubble fish, you'll set out to uncover all of the gold bars in each maze. But you'll have to be careful: Sea Urchins will relentlessly pursue Bubbles, and there are also dangerous black holes that must be avoided. Bubbles isn't defenseless, though, as she has the ability to stun Sea Urchins with sound waves and quickly change direction using posts scattered throughout the stages. Not only that, but the locations of the gold bars in each maze form the outline of another object -- once you know the object, you're well on your way to finding the gold.

7.1	Good	Donkey Kong 3-e is a direct emulation of the NES cartridge, which itself was a port of the sequel that hit arcades in the early 80s. The game design takes a tremendous departure from the Donkey Kong gameplay, taking a much more dramatic leap from Donkey Kong Jr. than Donkey Kong Jr. did from the original Donkey Kong; the only connection this sequel has to previous games in the Donkey Kong brand is, of course, Donkey Kong himself. In the game, players take control of Stanley the bug man, using his bug spray to not only exterminate the insects flying around, but also to scoot Donkey Kong up the vines by blasting him in the crotch. Getting Donkey Kong up the vines will sometime knock down a much more powerful blaster that can pretty much wipe out any insect fluttering around...not to mention getting Donkey Kong up higher with more powerful crotch-sprays.

Success in Tropico 2: Pirate Cove depends on careful management of the pirate population. As dead men earn no plunder, the King must keep his pirates well equipped for potentially lethal missions.

To aid Wario in his quest to establish a software company and satisfy his money hungry urges, players work their way through town, playing the challenges each of the characters throw at them; 9-Volt, for example, only dishes out challenges based upon classic Nintendo games; Dribble & Spitz offer up Sci-Fi-based mini-games. Kat hands over games based around nature. The game's ladder ends at the top with a competition against Wario, where he throws out a random assortment of games for the player to accomplish.

The game allows players to create new cities, improve their city infrastructure and expand national borders. Players have the option to win through military might using everything from slingshots to cannons to stealth bombers, or they can corner the market on key commodities as they wheel and deal with a wide variety of nations.  Unlike other historical RTS games, Rise of Nations allows gamers to quickly play through eight historical epochs of time from the Ancient Age to the Information age, covering 6,000 years of history. Gamers can play a quick battle on any map as one of 18 nations, or play the non-linear single-player Conquer the World Campaign.

8.3	Great	This Angel-developed street racer deals out more than 28 street machines over three massive cities. Depending on the race, players can either follow an obvious course or find their own routes, using quick instincts and knowledge of the city's side streets, alleyways, shortcuts and ramps. Like the first in the series, the open design provides players with intelligent choices to make, instead of fixed rails in which to proceed. Career mode starts players off in a city and enables them to freely choose an opponent by flashing their lights, communicating the desire to drag. The game supports four-player split-screen racing and online play for up to eight.

The game takes place in over 12 levels in three settings, Ancient Greece, Ancient China and Medieval Russia. You play the role of William Rockwell, aka Will Rock, a former accountant who leaves his job, nagging wife and suburban home behind to find biblical treasures described in an old diary written by his grandfather, a world-renowned archaeologist.

Each move reduces a player's available ""Mojo,"" which can only be replenished by collecting the specific number of Mojo blocks needed to advance to the next stage.

Mojo! offers more than 100 stages set within three distinct environments and includes an editor feature so players can design their own custom levels. As the game progresses, players will encounter obstacles in the form of death blocks, repulsers, and attractors that require new strategies to overcome. Some levels also feature multiple platforms connected by warps, portals, and slides. Up to four players can compete simultaneously in specially designed battle arenas as well as a variant of miniature golf that has them quickly rolling the ball toward different holes."

As the last hope of the Jedi, you must lead a band of freedom fighters in an epic struggle to save the galaxy. Can you master the awesome power of the Force on your quest to save the Republic? Or will you fall to the lure of the dark side? Hero or villain, savior or conqueror you must choose wisely as you alone will determine the destiny of the entire galaxy.

Players train as a Jedi Knight and choose which path of The Force they want to follow: the honorable Light Side or the passionate Dark Side. The hybrid combat system combines turn-based and action elements into a totally new style of gameplay: slow enough to let players soak up the details of the story, but never bogged down by fruitless quests or collection tasks."

The Great Escape unfolds over twenty missions ranging from the stealth elements in Stalag Luft, to running from the Nazis through a Teutonic castle, Luftwaffe airfield, a hospital, and a train. In addition to adventure elements, once you escape from Stalag Luft, you'll actually have a chance to fight your way to freedom. At your disposal will be over ten authentic WWII weapons you'll fire into prison guards, Nazi soldiers, and the Gestapo. In your race to freedom, you'll also be able to commandeer jeeps, APCs, trucks, and motorcycles as you flee from the German army.

, a vampire-hunting action and adventure game that not only encourages players to get outside and play in the fresh air...it almost requires it. Utilizing a special cartridge with a built-in a sun sensor, the amount of sunlight outside the game determines how much sunlight shows up in the actual adventure. And since the player's gun is actually fueled by sunlight, the more sunlight you can get the stronger and more capable you are in the game."

8.0	Great	Featuring characters from The Lion King, Tarzan and Toy Story 2, Extreme Skate Adventure offers a Tony Hawk-like adventure mode with preset goals set in non-traditional skating environments, including the Elephant Graveyard, Pride Rock, Andy's Room, Pizza Planet, and Tarzan's Treehouse. Instead of skaters, you play as 12 popular Disney and Pixar characters, like Buzz, Woody, Simba, Pumba & Timon, and Young Tarzan, who grind and ollie around the levels on skateboard equivalents like bamboo rafts and frying pans. Add to that two-player split-screen challenges and plenty of recognizable enemies and friends from the movies, and this kid-friendly game can be just as fun to play for older gamers as well.

Eventually, after years of tyranny and chaos, the good armies of the nearby lands, headed by the infamous Circle of Eight descended into the temple and razed it, imprisoning the villains inside. For years thereafter-relative peace ensued, as daring adventurers slew the remaining monsters that ravaged the land above and the temple itself faded into but a distant memory until now. Bandits have begun to patrol the roads outside Hommlet and Nulb again. Wicked forces are rumored to be afoot, converging on the ruined temple for malevolent purposes.

You control Kirby with the analog stick and the A button -- that's it. The stick steers the character left and right (he accelerates perpetually) and the A button when pressed slows him down and when released delivers a temporary speed boost. The idea is to hold the button down around corners, drift them, and then shoot out with a burst of speed. The game features a four-player split-screen mode and LAN support for link-up play."

6.0	Okay	Atari's series of Backyard sports games hits the court with BACKYARD BASKETBALL. As with the other Backyard titles, players put together a team from over 30 of the Backyard kids and ten kid versions of top NBA stars. Players have a variety of characters to put on their team, including kid versions of Yao Ming, LeBron James, Shaquille O'Neal, Tracy McGrady, Dirk Nowitzki, and others. All 30 NBA teams are available along with several Backyard Teams like the Jumpin' Gym Rats. Players can also create their own kids and teams. Once the game starts, players direct the action as their team tries to score as many points as possible. Unlike other, more traditional, basketball games, BACKYARD BASKETBALL includes a number of power-ups players can grab to give them things like super speed or jumping power. There are a number of different courts, too, including one on the beach, a playground, and a street court. Players have several play options, including a season mode, quick game, and two different mini-games to play. The game tracks a number of statistics through the season, both for players and teams, and custom-created players will actually gain experience and improve with time. BACKYARD BASKETBALL includes everything that makes the Backyard series so much fun: crazy gameplay, fun characters, and all the excitement of a basketball game. With a game link, players can even go head-to-head with friends. BACKYARD BASKETBALL is a treat for basketball fans who are looking for a new challenge.

A third-person shooter from Namco, kill.switch is a mission-based jaunt with 16 different weapons, 15 scenarios, and an emphasis on finding cover for protection. Players can dynamically use their environment as cover -- conform to objects and terrain, popping out to fire from protected positions. There is also a blindfire move that lets the main character fire without even looking.

John Bradley, Paul Foley, Mick Connors, and David Jones are back once again to team up and once again take on Saddam's henchmen. Whether it's protecting friendly choppers from enemy fire, the burning oil fields, Iraq's chemical weapons program, or secret superguns, there was apparently enough unfinished business left to serve as the basis for a second game. For the sequel, the developers improved on the team-mate AI and game UI, but the biggest attraction is once again the co-operative multiplayer mode.

8.5	Great	Set to the backdrop of a distant universe inhabited exclusively by robots, Glitch is on an adventure to save his home planet Iron Star from the evil General Corrosive and his various mechanical minions. You take control of the colorful machine -- think of him as a mini-mech -- who seems innocent enough but in actuality is armed to the teeth with various weapons and unique abilities. The setup results in an experience that approaches perpetual carnage, and it's all paced along and broken apart by some witty banter, too. But the real draw is the character's ability to sneak up behind robot foes equipped with open rear data panels and hack into and take control of them. Add to that split-screen multiplayer battles, and you've got total robot destruction, third-person-shooter-style.

8.6	Great	Set to the backdrop of a distant universe inhabited exclusively by robots, Glitch is on an adventure to save his home planet Iron Star from the evil General Corrosive and his various mechanical minions. You take control of the colorful machine -- think of him as a mini-mech -- who seems innocent enough but in actuality is armed to the teeth with various weapons and unique abilities. The setup results in an experience that approaches perpetual carnage, and it's all paced along and broken apart by some witty banter, too. But the real draw is the character's ability to sneak up behind robot foes equipped with open rear data panels and hack into and take control of them. Add to that split-screen multiplayer battles, and you've got total robot destruction, third-person-shooter-style.

9.1	Amazing	"The first in the series to be released in the US,

shares many similarities with another strategy game on the GBA:

. That's because it's been designed by the same development studio. The differences are subtle but important: where players control anonymous troops in the AW series, players command an array of different characters in

. If one of these characters dies during battle, he or she (or it) is gone for good, and will never be available in future missions. This added element means that players will have to really consider their strategies when attempting to complete the several dozen challenges in this lengthy storyline."

Players must make strategic choices as to which weapons to use, ranging from silent and stealthy to loud and destructive. Everyday items may be the key to your survival, as plastic bags become instruments of strangulation, and shards of glass your defensive weapons. Escape the nightmare that is Carcer City and maybe you'll learn the identity of the mysterious ""Director""."

4.3	Bad	There's turmoil in the island of Mata Nui. The dark spirit Makuta has infected the Rahi throughout the island -- using his control of the Bohrok, Bohrok-Kal, and Rahkshi to kidnap the Matoran villagers throughout the various Wahi. It's up to the guardians of each Wahi, the Toa warriors Tahi, Lewa, Kopaka, Gali, Pohatu, and Onua, to rescue the Matorans and find the Toa of Light, who is the only one strong enough to stop Makuta. Players control the six Toa heroes in this blend of platform action, combat and racing. Use elemental powers to defeat enemies, then snowboard down mountains, surf through lava fields, ride mine carts and grind along tree limbs.

4.7	Bad	EA Sports returns to the slopes and the insanely fast-paced action of snowboarding with SSX 3 for the GBA. Combining racing with tricks, the game allows players to choose from different events and challenges as they desire. The story mode of SSX 3 involves, like the previous entries in the series, becoming the best snowboarder in the world. Players have a cast of characters to select from, most of whom have appeared in previous SSX games. Once players have selected their character, they're off to the slopes to start winning races and performing huge tricks. The main mode has 12 different events players can participate in. Players select the event they want to compete in from the map. There are races, super pipe, big air, and other events, and there's something for everyone. Winning these events nets the player cash which can be used to upgrade their equipment. In addition to winning the race, players want to look good doing it, and that's where the tricks come in. Pull off enough of them, and the player's boost meter fills, rewarding them with some extra power. Complete enough tricks and the character learns new, even more dangerous and impressive tricks. Gamers who love snowboarding will enjoy SSX 3. While players can't explore as freely as they can in the console version of the game, the racing is still intense, and the many different game play options keep the game from getting boring or repetitive.

9.3	Amazing	"The role-playing game from veteran developers Bioware is set in an ancient version of the Star Wars universe, when both Jedi and Sith number in the thousands. It is four thousand years before the Galactic Empire and hundreds of Jedi Knights have fallen in battle against the ruthless Sith. As the last hope of the Jedi, you must lead a band of freedom fighters in an epic struggle to save the galaxy. Can you master the awesome power of the Force on your quest to save the Republic? Or will you fall to the lure of the dark side? Hero or villain, savior or conqueror you must choose wisely as you alone will determine the destiny of the entire galaxy.

Players train as a Jedi Knight and choose which path of The Force they want to follow: the honorable Light Side or the passionate Dark Side. The hybrid combat system combines turn-based and action elements into a totally new style of gameplay: slow enough to let players soak up the details of the story, but never bogged down by fruitless quests or collection tasks."

Your job is to step on the corresponding button at just the right time, essentially dancing to the beat. It's a great formula that is as addictive as it is simple. Ultramix features around 50 songs, online play via Xbox Live, and a variety of off-line modes.

8.0	Great	Real-time strategy game that concerns itself specifically with the events that occurred between 1836 and 1920. Four successive campaigns let you play as one of many Great Powers on the world stage, but you can also take the helm of other nations, like Beroda, Annam, Kutch, or the Ionian Islands. It's certainly possible with a little personal help to move the likes of Argentina or Japan closer to the center of the 19th century world stage. Victoria is played on a 2D world map, with four zooming levels. If you feel the need to jump to an unseen portion of the globe, you can always use the handy mini-map. Victoria allows you to combine a mix of locally harvested resources such as grain, lumber, or coal, with others you can purchase from an entity known as the World Market. In addition to three economic classes, there are also 10 population types that represent your civil and military forces to consider.

Whether it's protecting friendly choppers from enemy fire, the burning oil fields, Iraq's chemical weapons program, or secret superguns, there was apparently enough unfinished business left to serve as the basis for a second game. For the sequel, the developers improved on the team-mate AI and game UI, but the biggest appeal is once again the split-screen co-operative multiplayer for up to four players.

Although there were 450,000 Allies lost in conflict (and, to date, there are still more than 8,000 servicemen unaccounted for), Communist casualties amounted to nearly 2 million.

		The cell version of Haunted Mansion is more of a puzzle game than an actioner. You must complete a series of rooms by dispersing ghosts with your flashlight, sealing off ghost generators, and turning the lights on before moving on to the next area. Clearing a room is a several step affair. First, you must eliminate the initial batch of ghosties by blasting them with your flashlight beam, then you must search the paintings on the wall. Seal off generator hot spots with your flashlight (otherwise new ghosts will lurch out of the walls and attempt to turn the lights off). As soon as the lights are one, you can unlock the door and move on to the next room.

Duke Nukem Mobile is a fast,  furious sidescrolling shooter with plenty of the voice sample one-liners the series is famous far.  Duke runs from left to right (and sometimes back again), clearing out aliens that have descended to earth with one mission: destroy humanity. The Duke isn't about to tolerate this, so with gun in hand, you must clear out each level. There is usually a locked door at the end of each street or alley, so keep blasting until the keycard appears in the entrails of a fallen foe. Some enemies drop armor and health, but always be on the lookout for abandoned ammo.

		Archon-like strategy game. Two sides sit across from each other on a chess-like board. Every character has its own limited range of movement. Strategically take squares on the board, and when another character occupies a space you want/need, you duke it out in a short action sequence. The action sequences take place in different kinds of terrain. Forests, rocky regions, and desert are a few of the territories in dispute. Weather effects also come into play. Should you challenge a flying beast for a space currently drenched by a torrential downpour, you will be at an immediate advantage, as wet wings slows down your opponent.

7.1	Good	Taking place in a time period between the two PC games (Fallout 1 and Fallout 2), this action-RPG based on the Dark Alliance engine sees the player character join the Brotherhood of Steel, a band of vigilant humans seeking to maintain peace in the now trademark grim post-apocalyptic world. The player's team finds itself instantly engaging in battles with raiders, mutants and a bevy of radioactive nightmares using a mixture of 50 different up-close melee and ranged weapons. Gamers can get right into the mix in the single-player, story driven game, or if a close friend is at hand, both can start up a co-op game to play from start to finish.

7.5	Good	Return to the world of the COMBAT MISSION series with CDV Software's COMBAT MISSION 3: AFRIKA KORPS for the PC. Running on the same engine as the previous COMBAT MISSION game, Afrika Korps presents dozens of new scenarios, new units, new features, and more of that great turn-based World War II action that gamers love. Gamers control armies of hundreds of different units, each with its own abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Each turn, gamers give orders to their units and vehicles, and then, after both sides have mapped out their commands, players watch and see how the action unfolds. This time, the battles are set in Africa, Italy, and Crete, and the game takes place over five years, from late 1940 to 1945. Over 70 battles are covered, many of which are based on historical fights. The maps in Afrika Korps force players to develop new strategies. There is relatively little cover on the African plains, and gamers will find that vehicles are suddenly the key to winning, especially tanks. Players shouldn't discount other units, however. It will take a careful combination of all different types of forces to win the battle. Many different units are represented in the game, including forces from the US, Canada, Italy, Poland, Australia, and five others. The previous COMBAT MISSION games took the world by storm, and COMBAT MISSION 3: AFRIKA KORPS is prepared to do the same. The challenging missions, huge armies, and great gameplay make it a solid combat game.

8.8	Great	A real-time strategy game for cellphones. The kingdom of Thorin is divided, and it's up to you, the true king to get a band of loyal supporters together and remove your usurping brother from the throne. You begin the story mode as the lone king, and must use your current castle to build up troops to aide in the reclamation of your authority. The variety of troops is a mesh of warriors, archers, and mystical creatures such as lizard men, gollums and dragons, each with their own look and attack. You essentially spend the game building up your troops through occupying small villages and castles, spawning new troops along the way. The goal of each level varies, but is usually seeking out a character, or destroying everyone, or reaching a certain area.

8.1	Great	The critically acclaimed platformer makes its way onto the N-Gage. He may appear to have no body to connecting his limbs and head, but Rayman should not be underestimated. In this cartoon-style action-platform game, Rayman must extract the Dark Lum lord, who has been swallowed by his rather dumb friend Globox. With over 50 maps spread across eight universes, plus an N-Gage exclusive four-player Capture The Flag mode, Rayman 3 provides a feast of action-platform gameplay. Some levels focus on swinging from multiple grappling points, bouncing on a succession of springy platforms, waterskiing behind a speedy snake, or running wildly on the back of a walking missile	Gameloft	Platformer	8.5	Great	NNG GBA PS3 PS2 Mac Xbox PC GCN Xbox 360 Cell digiBLAST Wii U	14.99 USD	Gameloft	E for Everyone	Mild Animated Violence	http://www.ign.com/games/magical-hoppers/nng-567021,http://www.ign.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-1/nng-573371,http://www.ign.com/games/operation-shadow/nng-616991,http://www.ign.com/games/the-king-of-fighters-extreme/nng-682883,http://www.ign.com/games/hooked-on-creatures-of-the-deep/nng-827268	December 16, 2003	http://ngage.ign.com/articles/449/449319p1.html	Rayman 3

Four teams of three characters: Team Sonic, Team Dark, Team Chaotix, and Team Rose race through specially designed levels that require logical character switching.

7.8	Good	A cell phone fishing game.  Instead of trolling shallow waters, lazily hunting bass, you're sent out into seawaters to pull in the most vicious quarry: sharks. Choose from a few different coastlines to start the hunt: Sydney, San Francisco and South Africa. Each location looks decidedly different, as you can always catch a glimpse of the coast off the horizon. Then you're given a weight and time requirement. To win, you must haul in the heaviest sharks during a specific time limit. As the shark fights, you must use the touchpad to maintain the dot's position in the center. If it strays too far for too long, your line breaks.

7.9	Good	"Square's first game for a Nintendo console since the days of the Super NES takes the lush fantasy world from the Final Fantasy franchise and adds in hack-and-slash-style four-player action. The game does away with traditional experience points and instead focuses on action-oriented combat with a unique co-op slant. Up to three friends can join in on the quest, by using Game Boy Advance units connected to the GameCube as controllers. While all the main action takes place on the screen, the GBAs enable the players to access menus, organize their spell spheres, and perform upgrades without slowing down the action.

The initial release of this game included a GBA Cable to allow players instant access to the game."

7.1	Good	Alex the Ant is a simple tile-moving game for cell phones, designed so anybody can quickly get into it. Gameplay is similar to Pipe Dream, but instead of moving aqua, you've got to create a dirt highway so the little fella can reach the surface. Alex starts on in a small empty patch, and you must rearrange the tiles to forge his path to the surface -- all set against a time limit. There are twenty-five dirty levels for Alex to survive. Rearranging tiles in the upper levels is some serious brain work, as if you allow the wandering Alex to step into nothingness, it's game over. Fortunately, there is a save game feature that allows you to instantly hold your place.

8.2	Great	The traditional R-Type shooting gameplay system is back in full force, and with some fresh new features as well. Your first power-up equips your ship with a support craft that can be used in a variety of ways. A single button press makes the support craft dock with either your ship's front or back where it acts as a shield against enemy attacks and also launches out laser blasts of its own. By having the support craft collide with things, you make it build up a charge which eventually turns into a devastating bomb. You start off with just three selectable ships, each with different weapons and power-ups, with new ships being unlocked as you progress.

Sing and dance with your hands to match the combination of buttons displayed on screen and your contestant sings a sweet harmony, dancing to the rhythm of the song.

8.1	Great	With Ancient China as the backdrop, the ninth installment in the franchise chronicles the dramatic events of the 2nd and 3rd centuries when the once grand empire fell into civil war. While retaining many of the features that have become hallmarks of the Romance series, RTK IX is vastly different. Most notable is that players immediately take the rank of a Ruler. Traditionally reserved as the highest rank in the series, the role of Ruler will test any player's leadership, management and strategy skills. Combat has also evolved and takes place at a much higher tempo. The game features 20 historical and fictional scenarios with multiple story endings and epilogues, additional challenges, 34 special event sequences, and over 30 different tactics and 12 military formations.

8.2	Great	This is a faithful and accurate wireless port of the NES classic. For those who have never ventured into Dracula's castle before in the boots of a Belmont, this wireless wonder is a great place to start. Latter-day Castlevania games have become sprawling affairs where you must juggle items and map out major castles. The original is just pure run-jump-and-whip fun. Simon Belmont is turned loose in Dracula's castle to square off against the undead, like zombies and bats, in a quest to find the great vampire's lair and whip him into submission.

		Atlas Solitaire For Prizes! is one of Atlas Mobile's prize-winning tournament games, where gamers sit down to a 52-card deck and try to bust out a solution in record time. If you know how to play solitaire already, you're ready for online play -- but Atlas Mobile included a nice practice game for beginners or people that need to refresh their skills at the loneliest card game ever created. The neatest thing about this game, other than the whole free stuff angle, is that every deck is solvable. Using some super-secret tech, Atlas Solitaire For Prizes! only deal out decks that can be completed -- which certainly alleviates the frustration of playing for twenty minutes before you realized you were screwed from the get-go.

		Imagine blackjack on speed. Then imagine somebody handing you a $10 gift certificate at Starbucks for playing blackjack on speed. There's the essence of Atlas Solitaire For Prizes! The goal is to get 21 -- any way possible. Whether that's through a natural blackjack or a Five-Card Freddy. (Five cards add up to 21 -- not an easy feat.) The clock is ticking, pardner. How many times can you score 21 out of a 52-card deck? You have four rows of cards in play. Try to clear each line of cards by creating combos of 21. Each regular combo is worth 5,000. A Blackjack Wild (jack of spades or jack of clubs) is worth 7,5000. The biggest combo is a Five-Card Freddy, worth 10,000 points.

		Switchix For Prizes!, one of the straight puzzle games in Atlas Mobile's service, is very reminiscent of Bejewelled which seems to come pre-loaded on every single PDA. The game presents the player with a board full of symbols -- based on one of four themes, such as flowers and sports. The goal is simple, flip the pieces around to create combos of three. The pieces disappear and points are awarded. Of course, if you can manage to create bigger combos of four or more, as well as cause chain reactions, the points flow like wine at a wedding. A time meter sits on the right side of the screen, constantly dropping. One the left is a score meter, which you must fill as quickly as possible. Fill it before time runs out, and it's on to the next puzzle. The game ends (successfully) when you beat the fourth puzzle.

10.0	Masterpiece	Atlas Mobile has taken the classic block-busting game and converted it into a chance to win free stuff as Tetris Tournament For Prizes!, published by Blue Lava Wireless. Like its predecessor, Tetris Tournament is a simple game of arranging falling blocks of different shapes, trying to fill in lines. The more lines you can fill in with one fell swoop, the more points you get. Nailing four lines at once is called a tetris. Tetris Tournament takes the never-ending puzzler and puts a cap on it. Each game ends when you either clear forty lines or when time expires. This keeps games from lasting hours on end, thumbs from going numb, and minutes-used from destroying your credit rating. This is pure, classic Tetris -- but the heated competition adds another level of excitement to the simple block-tosser.

		As the manager of a new snowboard park, it's your job to manage all of the parks resources and eventually turn this plain-jane resort into a powdery paradise. All you need is a little intuition, a lot of luck, and a half-pipe. You begin with a clean slate of a mountainside. Using your initial meager funds, select from a variety of park pieces, such as bumps, jumps, grind rails, and half-pipes. Place them about the park in a fashion that will excite and intrigue the lemming-like snowboarders. The better your piece placement, the more buzz tour restore generates -- resulting in greater cash flow. What to do with that green? Reinvest it in the resort, upgrading facilities and installing new attractions. Pretty soon, you'll have the 'boarders lining up shred your slope.

		Perhaps you remember SEGA's Fast Lane, with all it's Pac-Man copycat racing madness? You control a little red car, trapped in a maze of walls and dots. Your mortal enemy? A maniacal yellow hot rod that is hell bent on matching your every move in an effort to cause a head-on collision. The only way to avoid a higher insurance premium is by keeping one step ahead (or behind) by changing speed. Speed up to make it to the interchange just before the yellow car can, or slow down to let it breeze by. The goal of the car is to collect all of the dots in each maze by running over them. It's very Pac-Man, but without ghosts.

It's a classic twitch game where you must maneuver through a maze of ice blocks, avoiding direct contact with the nasty Sno-bees. Seems these arctic denizens have a mad-on for Pengo, and the only way to cool them off is by smashing them between ice blocks. But Pengo is about more than squishing Sno-bees. There are several diamond ice blocks in each level, and should Pengo line these up before time runs out or the Sno-bees have been out in deep freeze, his score will skyrocket.

Players engage in both single and multiplayer battles with more than 30 fierce, mythological creatures from four realms. The creatures take turns moving on a tactical map screen, with the ultimate goal of capturing strategically placed temples. When a battle starts, the overhead world view shifts to a battle angle, and the two battle it out in real time, playing out much like a 3D action-fighter. Each character has special attributes, powers and attacks, but all characters have the power to unleash their wrath to defeat opponents and dominate the universe.

		"A good few years back, television watchers warmed to the animated tales of a cat and dog combo, known as ""Ren & Stimpy."" They shared a home, heartfelt loyalty, and extreme bouts of flatulence. And America loved it. However, after some bizarro legal wrangling forced the show's creator off the project, the quality spiraled resulting in Ren Hoek and Stimpy the Cat to submit to the stink of cancellation. After much time, though, the series has been resurrected by Viacom on the Spike TV network.

The game is a seemingly endless affair of tower jumping and pointy-object throwing, the hallmarks of any good, classic arcade experience. Control is quite simple. You jump, you press up. This launches you into the air, where hopefully, you'll find footing on the next platform. Too bad the next ledge is usually host to evil ninjas that often return the shurikens you throw their way. When you find yourself on the dangerous end of a shuriken, you can either press down to drop back to the previously platform, or deflect the blade with a shuriken of your own.

Your mission is simple: make everything on-screen go boom. And should you accept this mission, you better have the thumb fortitude to go the distance, because the foes of DoDonPachi are nothing if merciless. The boss battles fill about half of the screen with a giant enemy cruiser. A power bar appears on top of the screen, showing how must life the enemy has left.

Ships don't just zig and zag rigidly, they swerve along the ocean leaving a convincing wake behind them. Bullets move slowly enough to dodge, and shooting down an entire string of enemies will usually net you a power-up, changing your primary weapon to stronger blasts or a double-shot. You can also earn a 'big bomb' attack, which varies depending on the powerups you collect. Most of the game has you shooting down little gnat-like planes, destroying bases on the ground below or taking out components of a larger enemy.

If you're not familiar with the way the game works, JAMDAT has included a tutorial that nudges you along while you learn the ropes. Make sure you use the green overview so you know the course ahead, select your club, and fire up the swing meter. The swing meter is a multi-colored arc that appears around your player. Press the action key to begin filling the meter. When the ball reaches the small green silver, tap action again -- this selects the optimal amount of power. Then, the meter starts back down. Tap the action again when the meter crosses the bottom green silver -- this controls the accuracy of the shot.

7.2	Good	EYE TOY: GROOVE is the successor to EYE TOY: Play, Sony's first Eye Toy game for the PS2. The Eye Toy, for players unfamiliar with it, is a camera that connects to the PS2 and projects a mirror image of the player on the screen. It recognizes hand and body movements, turning the player's body into the controller. In single-player mode, dots appear and move toward one of six these circles on the screen as music plays. The goal is to move your hand over the circle as the dot moves over it. Timing is everything, of course: getting the dot and circle lined up exactly scores you bonus points. As levels progress, the game throws in extra challenges. Dots with trails behind them make you shake your hand over the circle for a few extra seconds. The circles can also change into arrows for your hands to follow. A few times per round, the game will move into pose mode, asking players to strike the indicated pose to score points. In addition to the single-player game, EYE TOY: GROOVE includes a multiplayer mode for up to four people and a custom mode where players can create their own moves. In multiplayer mode, players can either challenge each other or work together to clear the dots. With these different modes, EYE TOY: GROOVE is a great party game. Eye Toy fanatics will enjoy the new challenges in Groove, and newcomers can see what the Eye Toy is all about.

		Aces of World War I is a cellphone game that mixes strategy with a little Warlords action. You control either the Axis and the Allies, each team positioned on opposite ends of the board. Now, each team has two bases, surrounded by defensive anti-aircraft guns designed to ward off intrusions. But the main action is sending your six squadrons of fighter planes into the field to dogfight the enemy, and eventually, take the Axis bases. Each turn begins with a roll of the dice. If you roll a six, you must move the full six spaces, even if that means you overshoot the enemy unit. If you do manage a roll that puts you in an adjacent square, you can attack -- the nature of which differs depending on the square you're in.  Card tactics also come into play as cards allow for specific types of attacks and maneuvers in the sky.

8.3	Great	Eidos Interactive's HITMAN: CONTRACTS for the Pc Games is the third game in the HITMAN series, which revolves around the assassin known only as 47. The game takes place as a series of flashbacks 47 sees as he lies dying. During these flashbacks, players experience a wide range of action and stealth missions as they shoot their way across the world. The flashback missions 47 sees during his injury-induced visions include some of the missions from the original game and some new missions, although the original missions have all been upgraded and expanded, so returning players won't feel like they're repeating previous games. Missions include eliminating a pair of brother assassins, disrupting a Russian arms deal, and escaping an asylum as he moves across the globe. Characters tend to speak in their native languages, as well, adding to the international flavor. 47 has many different abilities and weapons available. He can move stealthily, steal clothing to disguise himself, and use a number of poisons in addition to guns to take out his enemies. In many places, players have the option of accomplishing a mission using stealth or attacking enemies head-on, depending on their playing style. There are three difficulty modes, as well, so novice and experienced players can both enjoy the game. Shooter fans will find HITMAN: CONTRACTS a fun, entertaining game with a distinct noir style to it. Fans of the series won't be disappointed, either, as 47 relives many of his most exciting and dangerous missions.

8.8	Great	This is the sequel to Ubisoft's original Splinter Cell stealth action hit. The developers set out to take the light-and-shadow-based gameplay from the original and upgrade everything about it. Lead character Sam Fisher has an all-new set of moves at his disposal, including being able to climb higher after a split jump and a SWAT move across open doorways, and weapons have secondary functions. There are also plenty of new gadgets, including new vision modes, sonar devices, motion sensors, and secondary fire modes for his weapons. But the biggest upgrade comes in the form of a multiplayer mode that divides players into two teams: spies and mercenaries, each with specific gear, abilities and parameters.

7.0	Good	The set-up is simple. You're on one side of the table, the computer -- represented by a small red triangle -- is on the other. While not the most stunning visual choice, it certainly keeps things clean. And when the ball starts flying across the table, you'll be grateful you don't have a graphic of a little man to worry about. The goal is to rally the ball back and forth, hoping to make the computer miss. Expertly crafted AI insures that the computer is no push-over, but it's also no Forrest Gump, either. While keeping your eye on the ball and the triangle, use the 4, 6, and 8 buttons to smack the ball back whether it's coming from the left, center, or right.

Later that day, the once inhabitants of the village emerge from blood-red waters that now surround the remnants of the village. They're no longer human though, having been somehow transformed into zombies. Choose from multiple characters, including a teenage boy leading a blind girl and a teacher and student duo to make your escape from the nightmare town. Forbidden Siren incorporates haunting environments, eerily realistic characters complete with motion-captured facial expressions, and unsettling camera techniques, resulting in one of the most terrifying games to date.

Players must get through specific platform challenges by utilizing each character's strengths and abilities. Shrek is beefy, so he can carry items that can be stacked elsewhere, or butt-stomp weakened floors. Donkey can leap higher and kick down walls. Later on, players acquire new characters, like swashbuckling Puss In Boots who can cling to walls and grind down banisters, as well as plenty of other characters from the movie. Learn the attributes of each character's personality, attacks and abilities to progress through an action-packed quest. Use Shrek's ogre strength, Donkey's burro kick and Princess Fiona's ability to slow time.

You have access to new weapons and spells -- powerful magic that strikes fear, blindness, and confusion into your enemies. You still wander mazes and dungeons, slaying monsters by walking up to them and pressing an ""action"" button. Beating a dungeon usually gives you enough gold to head aboveground and buy new items, making future dungeons a little easier to survive -- and you'll need the help because the beasts are no push-overs.

8.1	Great	GameCube sequel to the Japan-only N64 mech battle titles. Players customize and build up their own mech soldiers by choosing from 200 different parts and weapons, then send them into battle in one of 30 different arenas. Arenas range from the canyon and warehouse stages found in the original game to all-new VR arenas. Each battle starts off with a casting of the dice -- only that these dice are the Robos in their undeployed state. They will then literally unfold Origami-style into the full-blown fighting machines. That's when the weaponry comes in. Using lasers, homing missiles, bombs, special attacks, tackles, and the all-important sentry drones, players blow each other sky-high in the battle for the cup.

Metal Slug Mobile is a side-scrolling action game, which holds its own against some of the bigger names in the category, like XIII and Prince of Persia. Of course, the pedigree certainly helps out, but much should be credited to Digital Bridges' design team. Metal Slug Mobile unfolds over eight different stages, ranging from a war-torn battlefront full of scalable scaffolding to a dark jungle combat zone. During most missions, you're running from left to right, dishing out Texas-style justice with your machine gun. There are also vehicle levels where your little soldier jumps behind the wheel of a tank or the yoke of a jet fighter and takes on the bad guys with some extra firepower.

Start off the action by selecting a monkey avatar from the game's cast: AiAi, MeeMee, GonGon, and Baby. From there, jump right on to the lane and start rolling. Once you choose your position on the lane, there are three meters to adjust prior to your roll. Once you manipulate all of those meters and gee-gaws, your monkey goes flying down the lane. Hopefully, you managed to pull everything off and you score a strike. There are two types of games in Monkey Ball Bowling: Standard and Challenge. Standard is just a regular ten frame match. Challenge offers off ten different pin patterns and gives you only twelve tries to flatten them all.

Features 12 huge levels set in Ancient Egypt and Ancient Rome, 10 different weapons, and a four-player link-up mode for multiplayer deathmatches.

		Soccer game from GameLoft, also released on Nokia N-Gage. The game offers up thirty-two different teams to play with, each team with individual stats like Power and Speed that definitely affect play. Sure, you may want to chose a particular country of preference, but if you want an extra push toward winning, consider putting border bias behind you and picking a high stat club. Despite Marcel Desailly Pro Soccer's excellent controls, the game does take some getting used to. We highly recommend you spend the time with the in-game tutorial that will take you through the basics, from passing to penalty kicks. Once you're comfortable on your feet, select the length of game -- three, five, and ten minutes -- and hit the field. From kick-off to goals, you will be pleasantly surprised by the level of detail Gameloft put into this little sim.

		features four pro teams: Chicago, Los Angeles, New York (Yankees), and Boston. Each of those teams has their full, official rosters. Now, player models don't exactly represent the different body styles of the individual players, but at least they play appropriate for their individual MLB stats. As the pitcher, you use the thumbpad to choose throws. Pressing up, depending on your pitcher, may be a fastball. To the left, a slider. Should your pitcher become fatigued, substitute from the bullpen. And you can choose from three pitching settings (slow, medium, and fast) to determine the level of challenge.

8.9	Great	Third installment in Capcom's popular ninja-vs-monsters themed action adventure series. Samanosuke plays exactly like he did in the first game. The game breaks free from the pre-rendered camera system of the predecessor to serve up a much faster and action-focused game experience. Main star Samanosuke plays much like he did in the first game, but the new second character Jaques (featuring the likeness of Jean Reno), is a much different type of experience. In control of an energy whip, Jacques can smack his enemies high and low and even grab them in a python-like grip for additional maneuvers. The game will feature locales ranging from feudal Japan to modern-day Paris, France.

A new scoring system encourages players to get high scores and earn Gold Medals, which are used to unlock hidden levels, new features, cheats and more.

7.2	Good	Spyro Orange is Vicarious Visions' first Spyro the Dragon title, taking the reigns after Digital Eclipse's GBA trilogy. For Spyro's fourth appearance on the Game Boy Advance, the development team has given the dragon a more traditional side-scrolling environment for his overworld instead of taking him back to his isometric exploits. But the scrolling platformer is only part of the experience. Spyro Orange focuses on dozens of mini-challenges for its gameplay, like a vertical shooter where Spyro floats around blasting sheep or collecting gems, a rapid-button-tapping challenge involving tug-o-war and ice cube creation, or driving around in a tank, or knocking out a series of bad guys in a Breakout-style challenge. The game supports link cable play for multiplayer challenges.

		Based on the movie starring Jackie Chan, Around the World in 80 Days plays like a classic SNES movie game -- basic side-scroller formula that plugs in movie characters and set pieces. As Chan, you must fight a horde of faceless thugs in Paris and India, working to reach China where a priceless artifact must be returned to your village. Once the goods have been delivered, you must finish off the bad guys in New York. Now, you don't always have to confront these thugs face-on. You can sometimes gab hold of a hot air balloon and float above the city streets. If you can swing this tactic, go for it, because every time an enemy troop assaults you, you drop said priceless artifact, the Jade Buddha. You then need to pick it up before you can continue.

7.0	Good	For Crash Bandicoot's fourth outing on the Game Boy Advance, Vivendi Univeral once again went to Vicarious Visions (the development studio responsible for the previous three Crash games) for Crash Bandicoot Purple, a slight departure from the standard and familiar Crash platform design. Crash Bandicoot Purple is only similar to the previous Crash games initially. While the different realms feature platforming elements to get from point-to-point, the real focus is in its multitude of challenges. There are dozens upon dozens of mini-games scattered throughout Crash Bandicoot Purple that involve distinctly different gameplay elements; some require Crash to zip through an area with a jetpack, tank, or innertube. Others require a lot more quick reflexes in a sheep-blasting challenge or a weightlifting competition.

The game features five playable characters, and their vastly different abilities significantly change up the way each level is played. Sonic is balanced as a fast and furious runner, which makes him prime to beat the game quickly with the minimum requirements. But since this design puts a lot more focus on exploration and discovery by hiding little ""chao"" creatures in strategic locations all over the map, it's impossible to see everything without playing through each level multiple times. Players can use Sonic and Tails to beat the entire game at 100% and finish all seven worlds, but the fun is to open up the game with the three ""hidden"" characters Knuckles, Amy, and Cream.

Over time Sparta became renowned for having the strongest, fastest, bravest and most deadly fighters in the known world. They were the Spartaites and were feared by all. With these warriors Sparta carved out an Empire for itself –'Lakedaimon'. However, it was soon to find that its reign was not to be unopposed and other great cities were rising to the fore; Athens, Thebes, Corinth, Macedonia and not to forget the threat from the east – the massive Persian Empire.

8.8	Great	In 1987, Nintendo players were introduced to Link, a brave hero who had been summoned to the land of Hyrule to find the eight pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda from the evil Gannon. Players never imagined this magical quest would be the first of many for Link and Zelda, and now they can relive it all over again on the Game Boy Advance as part of Nintendo's Classic NES Series. Graphically, musically, and gameplay-wise, Nintendo has reproduced the classic LEGEND OF ZELDA on the Game Boy Advance, perfect for on-the-go gamers. The plot is fairly straight-forward: as Link, you must defeat a variety of enemies as you search for the hidden pieces of the Triforce. Once all eight are reassembled, you can enter Gannon's lair, defeat him, and save Zelda. Along the way, Link will pick up different items to help him in his quest, including a boomerang, bow and arrows, a raft, and some bombs. Once Gannon has been defeated, players get the option to start a new quest and play through ha remixed version of the game. For older gamers who have fond memories of slaying dragons with Link, here's your chance to turn back time. Fans of the more recent ZELDA games should take this opportunity to see where it all began. And for gamers who have never joined Link on a quest, pick up LEGEND OF ZELDA and experience a whole new gaming world.

The player controls the prisoner Torque, a hardened inmate in his late 20s, sentenced to die for a murder he may or may not have actually committed. Slightly mentally instable, Torque has flashbacks to the events from his past, throbbing images that depict the events that lead up to the crime for which he was imprisoned. The game features nine levels, frightening character morphs, and more than 10 deadly weapons from the shiv to the tommy gun to aid in the survival of this freakish nightmare.

6.6	Okay	Action adventure game, based on the famous Arthurian legends. In a remote part of Avalon, known as the floating isles, a now secluded Merlin was busy with the teaching of his apprentice, Memorick. And though Merlin poured all of his knowledge into the boy, Memorick's heart seemed to lie elsewhere. He secretly dreamed of justice, honor and knighthood... in essence, all things not wizardly. The player takes on the role of Memorick, a 15-year old young boy who chooses to defend his native land from the dark armies raised and trained by Morganna, sister to King Arthur, and her son, Mordred. The game features 19 different levels to explore and conquer, 26 different monster types, and four different gameplay modes: riding a horse, flying on a gryphon, sliding down on a shield and walking/running.

Like Van Helsing, Around the World in 80 Days, and others, I, ROBOT is a run from left to right (and sometimes back again) experience filled with plenty of enemies to punch or shoot. You begin the game as Sonny, the NS-5. Trapped in a futuro-house of other meanypants NS-5 units (you know they're bad because they glow red). You must punch these 'bots to the ground, ride elevators, and collect Nannites. In later levels, you are Del Spooner (Will Smith's character), running through a similar-looking building shooting up bad robots. As Dr. Calvin, you cannot really attack other robots -- you use stealth tactics to hide in doorways.

8.7	Great	Known in Japan as Tetsuwan Atomu, the Treasure-developed GBA game is based off the new Astro Boy cartoon that's currently airing on Japanese television. But even if you're only familiar with Tezuka's original manga or the 1980s show, you should recognize much of what's included. The makers of the game created an original story by putting together bits and pieces from the various episodes of the TV show. It feels somewhat like a collage of all things Astro Boy that's split into seven episodes each consisting of multiple gameplay and story sequences. The game itself takes two forms: side scrolling action and side scrolling shooting.

8.0	Great	Intelligence agencies are mentioning an increase in terrorist activity in every nook and cranny of the planet. The secret services are in a deadly uncomfortable spot, given the latest resounding failures. The CT Special Forces unit will once again be called upon to diffuse a series of international conflicts. Like the original, Back in the Trenches (formerly known as Back to Hell) is heavily inspired by SNK's classic Metal Slug series, with over-the-top side-scrolling shooting action. This sequel features 20 different levels in five locations, with four playable characters to choose from. Players have to take out the enemy threat with the different weaponry in the game, from machine guns to rocket launchers...even flame throwers. The sequel even features two player action through the use of link cable support.

7.3	Good	Released exclusively for Xbox in 2003, this third edition in the Tom Clancy series once again casts okayers in the role of Ding Chavez, the leader of a four-man team of Rainbow Six operatives who are sent around the world to answer terrorist threats with a minimal amount of attention and casualties. Players can engage in 15 specific missions with multiple goals and terrorist hunts. Although the GameCube version ditches the original's addictive online play, it features a split-screen (off-line) co-op mode not found in the Xbox version. The game retains the squad-based setup of the original and intelligent computer AI ensures a challenging and realistic tactical gameplay experience. Hunt down terrorists in dangerous environments, ranging from dangerous warehouses, to war-torn cityscapes.

6.7	Okay	Perhaps the best way to look at Driver 3 is by calling it what it is: a videogame take on a Hollywood car chase. Driver has always been about great car chases, superb physics and car crashes, and the third in the series is no different. Starring the series' quiet but rough unsung hero, Tanner, the undercover cop once again takes a clever carjacking network. Building on ideas implemented in Driver 2, players once again get the chance to steal an enormous load of cars (in fact, all cars in the game are jackable), are able to drive more cars than before (including trucks and boats), and are once again able to step outside of their cars.

6.9	Okay	Turn-based trading card roleplaying game. When players are in card combat with the opposition, the game moves from a card grid during the turn-based attacks to an open field to represent the creatures and spells battling each other. The GBA game features 180 creatures and spells from the base set and Alpha expansion set of the card game, represented graphically for handheld gamers. Since not everyone's familiar with the card game design, the developers have included a very intuitive tutorial that teaches the game's mechanics in an easy to follow step by step fashion. It even lets players watch the first battle so they can keep track of what's involved in each turn.

8.4	Great	PHANTOM BRAVE by Atlas USA is a quirky strategy RPG for the PS2 centered around Marona, a young girl who can see spirits. This isn't all it's cracked up to be, though; she's been exiled from her town for being possessed. So, with her dead, invisible guardian Ash by her side, she sets out to make some money as a mercenary and, as usual, gets swept up in a quest much bigger than she ever imagined. The battles in PHANTOM BRAVE involve you moving your army across the field to do battle. Turns are decided by stats, meaning some characters will get to attack more often. PHANTOM BRAVE throws out the conventional character recruitment system, however. Instead, Marona summons spirits from the netherworld to fight for her. But she can't just summon them anywhere; she has to channel their spirits into objects rocks, grass, etc each of which gives the summoned spirits different attributes and abilities. The battlefields in PHANTOM BRAVE aren't just backgrounds. Your characters can grab anything, even enemies, and throw them around. Certain objects on the battlefield offer stat-boasting protection or special abilities, too. If you think this game sounds odd, you're right, but that's the goal with PHANTOM BRAVE. The story and characters are humorous and, at times, even silly, but there's a deeper plot and even the silliest of characters has dimensions and personality. All of this combines to create a game that is ideal for strategy RPG players with a sense of humor.

6.7	Okay	The Guy Game is aimed squarely at testosterone-laden college students, spring breakers, and, well, any red-blooded American guy. Forming a sinful trinity, it combines boozing, nudity, and revelry. There's no question that it's a party game. It sets itself apart from other party games in that you don't have to pretend that it's a drinking game or fathom special party rules to make it work. Admit it: you've tried to turn everything from Super Monkey Ball to Eye Toy into alcohol-driven party games. The Guy Game doesn't pretend to be anything else; its style is a blend of Girls Gone Wild, the long-standing drinking game A**hole, and, well...You Don't Know Jack. For four players.

Gradius V preserves the franchise's classic gameplay and features stunning 3D graphics, inspired game design elements and a new control scheme that gives players more power than ever. Gradius V offers the choice of four different weapon configs prior to takeoff. All load-outs include basics like speed-up, laser and multiples. The big differences come in how each config treats its multiples. For example, the first load-out plays just like traditional Gradius games; the options merely follow the ship's movement. A new twist comes in the R1 button, which makes each config's options do something different. Also features music composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto (FF Tactics, Vagrant Story, Ogre Battle, and Radiant Silvergun).

		Isometric view adventure game that tries to inspire extended play sessions, not unlike JAMDAT's recent Neverwinter Nights. Dungeon Storm will remind you of some of an early '90s RPG, when 3-D graphics were first introduced to the genre. The game is a paced crawl through multiple, similar-looking dungeon levels with a rough semblance of story to tie together endless strings of fights. If this was your bag in '94, or if you dug those King's Field PSone games, Dungeon Storm is your drug of choice. Dungeons in the game are full of traps, like spike-covered poles, spike pads, and bottomless pits. Most can be avoided, but in certain cases, you must use the jump button to leap to safety.

Players control both heroes at once, similar to Nintendo's Mario & Luigi roleplaying game -- but the game is completely action-focused.

Features include huge battles inspired by the comics, with more than 70 Romans at once, spanning 40 different levels. Instead of going for a cel-shaded cartoon look, the game portrays Goscinny/Uderzo's world of 50 B.C. in a detailed 3D style, with plenty of humorous animations and special effects."

The game introduced  many now familiar platform game elements to gamers, such as ziplines and multi-character gameplay.

8.1	Great	The bad-luck Bandicoot is back in a new adventure that at completely breaks from the conventions of the PlayStation originals. The game ditches the 2 1/2D rail-based corridors, replacing it with a full 3D landscape, and it gives players the ability to take on the role of five characters, including Crash and even the once-nefarious Dr. Neo Cortex -- and characters can combine their talents to pull off combo attack moves! Through this unorthodox partnership, Crash and Cortex are controlled as one in this all-new gameplay mechanic. Gamers encounter highly reactive enemies, fully immersive environments and a wacky cast of all-new characters in Crash Bandicoot's craziest and funniest adventure ever.

7.8	Good	Aiming and moving in cover and blind-fire modes is tricky, though. To gain the 3-D effect, some detail gets sacrificed. Usually this is no problem, but occasionally you'll have a tough time recognizing an object. You move from area to area to engage a new group of enemies. You'll conveniently find crates for cover and barrels to help you pull off big explosions. Locking the enemy in your crosshairs, signified by your crosshairs turning red, doesn't guarantee a direct hit? The accuracy depends on the weapon of choice. A shotgun will normally provide a kill on the first shot. If you have an automatic rifle, your shots are relatively inaccurate even if your aim is true.

7.0	Good	It's no secret that casino games -- poker, specifically -- are all the rage, thanks to the ever-increasing poker presence on television. What you can, old-school Vegas (not the family-friendly abomination) is hot again, and JAMDAT Mobile aims to capitalize with Hard Rock Casino. This casino game features three games: poker, black jack, and slot machine. Dubbed Lonely Hearts Poker, the goal is to create a poker hand as good as or greater than a pair of tens. A couple of eights gets you jack. And you play all by yourself. There is no competition, hence the Lonely Hearts moniker. The slot machine section music-themed, but it's pretty much the same kind of three-line slot you can find on other games.

They need not fear death, yet cannot remember war's hard lessons and thus, will never know peace. It is the mortal races that suffer, as pawns in the Kohan's eternal game. Alliances are forged and broken, empires rise and fall; generations are born and die. As brothers bleed on each other's blades, an ancient force, timeless in its malevolence and tireless in its patience, watches silently, knowing its hour is nigh.

takes place over a year after the original ended, and finds Yuri embarking on a new expedition during World War I in a fantastical world of magic and creatures. Cursed by a secret cult that is taking advantage of the war to fulfill their evil ambitions, Yuri's morphing abilities are weakened. Yuri and his companions must journey to find a cure for his curse and defeat the malevolent cult. The American version was re-released in Japan in budget form on March 10, 2005.

7.2	Good	"In

, known as

in Japan, you play as an alien called Cosmi. Cosmi is from the Meiwaku star system (meiwaku is Japanese for troublesome). Residents of this star system must, when they turn three, head to a different star system to cause mischief. They aren't allowed to return home until they've reached maturity. Cosmi chooses Earth as his target and starts wrecking havoc. As Cosmi, you move around the 3D cel-shaded Coco Town, scanning people and taking on their form -- complete with their abilities. Gain a microphone, for instance, and you can start singing in a horrible voice. Gain a snowball and you can make people slip on the road. You can also perform mischief without items -- simply hitting people is one example. The game was developed at Capcom's Production Studio 4 and produced by Hiroyuki Kobayashi."

8.9	Great	"Wireless version of the famous skateboard game. Using your thumbs, you must guide your skater around six different cities, launching him off of ramps and jumps, grinding on rails and environmental features, and causing all sorts of mayhem in an effort to fulfill goals set forth by perverse skateboarding puppet-master, Tony Hawk. THUG 2 takes you across six different levels, from Boston to the ultimate thrash paradise of Skatopia. Along the way, you must collect items like cash and cellphones that often hover above certain jumps and grind targets. And you must always keep your eyes on the goals of the Hawk, such as breaking up environmental features and collecting certain items. Basic control is handled with the touch pad, jumps are assigned to the ""OK"" button, and ""1"" and ""3"" are used for tricks."

7.4	Good	In a conflict that lasted 11 years and killed over 3 million people, four men are going to have the longest 28 days of their lives. Cut off behind enemy lines during the 1968 Tet Offensive with no way to contact help, four young, barely trained soldiers realize their only hope for survival is to head into the heart of darkness. With few rations and dwindling ammunition, the only thing that separates them from freedom is 100 miles of ruthless terrain, crawling with unseen enemies. They don't want to win any war, they just want to make it home alive. In the the third game in the Conflict series of squad action war games, players take on 14 enormous missions deep in the Vietnamese jungle, venture through small villages, into ruined temples, and down Viet Cong tunnel complexes. Upgrades include a new control scheme and fully deformable environments.
