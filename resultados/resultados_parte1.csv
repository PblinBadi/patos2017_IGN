Admiral Perry has just opened Japan's borders to the British, allowing for a long-overdue globalization process to begin. Unfortunately, one of the open ports happens to be a modest Japanese burg called Amihama, where a resistance group known as the ""Disciples of Prajna"" have taken up arms against the arriving foreigners and all who support them.

As a lone samurai who's just arrived amidst the chaos, it's up to you whether you want to join forces with the Prajna resistance, fight alongside the foreigners in the name of progress or take your stance somewhere between the two by supporting the local government's attempts to quell the violence (through any means possible).",Acquire,Action,5.5,Mediocre,PS3 PC,39.99 USD,Xseed Games,M for Mature,,"http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/ps3-20006859,http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-online-mgs5/ps3-20028682,http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-5/ps3-149839,http://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-black-flag/ps3-161486,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/ps3-20594,http://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-freedom-cry/ps3-20009405,http://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/ps3-20006859,http://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-online-mgs5/ps3-20028682,http://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-dragonborn/ps3-146419","August 21, 2012",http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/03/way-of-the-samurai-4-review,Way of the Samurai 4,http://www.ign.com/games/way-of-the-samurai-4/ps3-23516

7.7,Good,"A sprawling role-playing epic set in a beautifully-realised game world, New Little King's Story follows the player as they assume the role of a King tasked with reclaiming his kingdom from an invader known only as 'The Nightmare.' King Corobo, a plucky 14-year-old royal, presides over a stricken land. The evil Nightmare is running havoc and the populace lives in fear as it preys on them. Thus, as Corobo, the user must unite their subjects in order to fight back and reclaim the kingdom.

New Little King's Story takes the form of a roaming role-playing title, with the player recruiting the isolated pockets of subjects into a unified army. Advisors and warriors will offer specific skills and attributes, adding skills to the growing army and enhancing their abilities. The game allows the user to move freely around the scrolling player in the search for recruits and for items that will aid the quest. The touchscreen of the PlayStation Vita handheld entertainment system allows the player to control and arrange recruits and send them into battle or to search areas with simple finger movements, with groups of subjects easily marshaled and moved. The game world changes dynamically as Corobo's army grows, confidence returns to the land, and the subjects return to their normal routines as the tide turns against the Nightmare.","AQ Interactive, Marvelous Entertainment",RPG,5.8,Mediocre,Vita,,Konami,"RP-T+ for Rating Pending, Targeting a Rating of Teen or Above",,"http://www.ign.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4/vita-116892,http://www.ign.com/games/child-of-light/vita-20018664,http://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-x-x-2-hd-remaster/vita-117911,http://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-2/vita-20004181,http://www.ign.com/games/ys-celceta-sea-of-trees/vita-103951,http://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-declassified/vita-98928","October 2, 2012",http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/11/new-little-kings-story-review,New Little King's Story,http://www.ign.com/games/new-kings-story/vita-116369

Milestone has streamlined every aspect of the game to allow new players instant gameplay satisfaction, while still allowing experienced rally gamers to explore the game's full range of features and drive a WRC car from the comfort of their own home. As well as all this, the game has improved crowd effects, rebuilt stages and new cinematic introductions to each stage. WRC 3 features more than 50 official WRC teams, alongside Class 2 and Class 3 series.

6.0,Okay,"Uncharted: Fight For Fortune is an action-adventure turn-based card game featuring the heroes and villains from the Uncharted universe. The core gameplay in Uncharted: Fight for Fortune involves creating a team of Faction cards featuring heroes, villains, and mercenaries from the Uncharted universe, then using that team to defeat your opponent while defending yourself from their attacks. Each Faction card can be equipped with powerful Resource and valuable Fortune cards, which enhance their stats and give them special abilities. Once you've selected and equipped a card, it's time to head into battle! During combat, attacks either reduce the health of opposing Faction cards or the health of your opponent. Defeating an opposing Faction card removes it from play, while reducing the health of your opponent to zero wins you the game.

This downloadable game connects up with the hit PlayStation Vita game Uncharted: Golden Abyss for players who want to further expand their card set. Using the 300 artifacts that can be found within Golden Abyss, you can go to battle with other players as well as AI opponents.
