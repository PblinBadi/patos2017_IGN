The game includes over 20 levels over 6 worlds, where Pac-man must adapt by using different ways of moving about including skating and swimming, which is one of the features that makes the second game stand out from the first. In PAC MAN WORLD 2, the play is exciting and intense the whole time. Not only do players have to avoid obstacles and minor opponents, but also players sometimes must fight one of the four ghost monsters.
