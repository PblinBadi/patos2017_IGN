The hook is that you don't have direct control -- the Meganite has no cockpit as such. Instead, the hero drives the Meganite by remote control, using a control device remarkably similar in design to a PlayStation Dual Shock. The game has two control schemes, one simple and one more complex. The latter gives independent control over the two legs and some other more flexible attack features.
