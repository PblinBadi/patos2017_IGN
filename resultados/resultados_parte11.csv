Running on the same engine as the previous COMBAT MISSION game, Afrika Korps presents dozens of new scenarios, new units, new features, and more of that great turn-based World War II action that gamers love. Gamers control armies of hundreds of different units, each with its own abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Each turn, gamers give orders to their units and vehicles, and then, after both sides have mapped out their commands, players watch and see how the action unfolds. This time, the battles are set in Africa, Italy, and Crete, and the game takes place over five years, from late 1940 to 1945. Over 70 battles are covered, many of which are based on historical fights. The maps in Afrika Korps force players to develop new strategies. There is relatively little cover on the African plains, and gamers will find that vehicles are suddenly the key to winning, especially tanks. Players shouldn't discount other units, however. It will take a careful combination of all different types of forces to win the battle. Many different units are represented in the game, including forces from the US, Canada, Italy, Poland, Australia, and five others. The previous COMBAT MISSION games took the world by storm, and COMBAT MISSION 3: AFRIKA KORPS is prepared to do the same.
