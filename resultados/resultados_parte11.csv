Players have a cast of characters to select from, most of whom have appeared in previous SSX games. Once players have selected their character, they're off to the slopes to start winning races and performing huge tricks. The main mode has 12 different events players can participate in. Players select the event they want to compete in from the map. There are races, super pipe, big air, and other events, and there's something for everyone. Winning these events nets the player cash which can be used to upgrade their equipment. In addition to winning the race, players want to look good doing it, and that's where the tricks come in. Pull off enough of them, and the player's boost meter fills, rewarding them with some extra power. Complete enough tricks and the character learns new, even more dangerous and impressive tricks.

Each turn, gamers give orders to their units and vehicles, and then, after both sides have mapped out their commands, players watch and see how the action unfolds. This time, the battles are set in Africa, Italy, and Crete, and the game takes place over five years, from late 1940 to 1945. Over 70 battles are covered, many of which are based on historical fights. The maps in Afrika Korps force players to develop new strategies. There is relatively little cover on the African plains, and gamers will find that vehicles are suddenly the key to winning, especially tanks. Players shouldn't discount other units, however. It will take a careful combination of all different types of forces to win the battle. Many different units are represented in the game, including forces from the US, Canada, Italy, Poland, Australia, and five others.
