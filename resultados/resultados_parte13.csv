Tolkien's classic trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, The Third Age videogame allows players to adventure through Middle-earth, building a party of heroes as they journey. Players battle on the side of the Fellowship, but can unlock additional encounters where they fight on the side of Sauron as they progress. In the game, players interact with the characters of the Fellowship in a unique structure, taking on individual quests while intersecting the major events of the film trilogy that drive the story forward. Parties traverse through both familiar and seldom-glimpsed locations, using an innovative turn-based battle system as they fight, encountering the demonic Balrog in the Mines of Moria, defending the fallen city of Osgiliath, or trying to destroy Helm's Deep.",The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age,http://www.ign.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-third-age/gba-679793,http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/562/562958p1.html,19.99 USD,6.0,GBA PS2 Xbox GCN,"November 2, 2004","http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-emerald-version/gba-692344,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-ruby-version/gba-17508,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-firered-version/gba-605909,http://www.ign.com/games/metroid-fusion/gba-16227,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-emerald-version/gba-692344,http://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-ruby-version/gba-17508",Good,7.4,"Blood, Mild Violence",T for Teen,Okay

Rather than fitting dropping pieces, your access is only to the blocks already in place. Click on any set of at least three adjacent same-colored blocks and they disappear, dropping the blocks above and possibly setting off a chain reaction. After a few seconds a new row of blocks appears below. You can see which colors will appear by watching the meter fill with the upcoming blocks. It's an interesting way to both measure the time before the next row emerges and to plan ahead for the blocks that are coming. Super Collapse II is the Jenga of puzzle games.

Sony Computer Entertainment,Action,Harmonix,"Sony's Eye Toy proved to be one of the most versatile, interesting peripheral devices for a console system, and EYE TOY: ANTIGRAVITY makes full use of the EYE TOY in ways that previous Eye Toy games haven't. For the first time, players aren't shown on screen for most of the game, and rather than a group of mini-games, AntiGravity is a full racing game. AntiGravity takes place in the future where players race others on a hoverboard through various courses as they perform tricks and pick up items. And instead of players using their arms or legs to control their hoverboard, the EYE TOY focuses on players' faces. Ducking determines speed and side-to-side head movement steers. While this will take some getting used to, it is intuitive enough that players will pick up the unique controls quickly. Players will also use their arms in AntiGravity to grab on to rails and other objects, plus sweeping them overhead causes the character to perform a trick. Some areas require players to duck or jump. A number of characters are available for players to choose from, and there is a good variety of courses, including industrial complexes, busy freeways, and even one level that has players plunging down the side of a skyscraper. While most other EYE TOY releases are collections of mini-games, EYE TOY: ANTIGRAVITY is a full racing game that gives players a new, unique steering mechanism.

Nintendo,Racing,Ambrella (Marigul),"Pokemon racing game for Nintendo DS. Players race against other Pokemon, pushing the character along by using the stylus to shove the character in the direction that the stylus is slid. The faster the player moves the stylus, the faster the character moves on-screen. The game makes use of both DS screens, with the racing action taking place on the touch panel screen and the top screen displaying a radar. In order to make it to the finish line before the competition, players constantly have to change direction as the path curves around the world. Tracks cut across forests, mud, and water, slowing the character down and requiring players to move the stylus across the screen more quickly in order to get through the hazards. The winner of a race is determined by which player gets to the checkpoints fastest.
